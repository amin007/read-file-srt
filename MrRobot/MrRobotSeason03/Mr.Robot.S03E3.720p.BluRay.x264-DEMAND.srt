1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,001
Tyrell Wellick.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,320
It's gonna be
fun working with you.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,249
I think you're beautiful
I want to take you home.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,528
<i>Detectives came by.
They want to speak with you.</i>

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,250
<i>They found a body on the roof.</i>

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,886
And you both did know
the deceased, Sharon Knowles.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,169
Our network was
compromised yesterday.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,969
<i>That server needs
to remain a honeypot.</i>

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,651
<i>We have specific orders by Tyrell
Wellick to keep the request as is.</i>

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,085
There's a reason we met.

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,049
There's something between us.
I can see it.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,770
You're not seeing
what's above you.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>Tyrell Wellick's gone.</i>

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,931
<i>I wake up in his SUV, and the
world's about to fall apart.</i>

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,525
We were there to
investigate the hack,

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,681
<i>and then we were under fire.</i>

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,723
What you want,
I want it, too.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,768
<i>Someone's trying to make
contact with me.</i>

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,001
<i>25th & 8th.</i>

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,560
<i>Stage 2, the femtocell,
the back door...</i>

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,051
<i>I want it shut down.</i>

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,724
I don't want to shoot
you, but I will.

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,326
<i>I've always told you we'd end
up working together, Elliot.</i>

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,250
Remember the night
of the hack?

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,080
Remember what happened to you?

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,001
What is it?

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,846
It's happening-

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,650
It's almost as if...

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,005
somethings come alive.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,004
Now wait
a minute, Elliot.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,729
Please, we should
talk about this.

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,201
No!

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,090
Did you see
what just happened?

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,681
Wait, wait, wait!

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,330
Do you not understand
what just happened?

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,004
The only thing that
happened is the gun jammed.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,525
It won't happen again.
No, no, no! This is proof.

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,045
Don't you understand?
This is proof.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,246
Proof of what?

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,922
Proof of what?

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,767
When you told me I couldn't
see what was above me,

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,806
only in front of me.

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,045
What the fuck
are you talking about?

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,526
We...

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,881
are Gods.

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,090
You really are
a lunatic.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,284
You held that gun
point blank at me and fired,

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,406
and yet I'm standing
right here talking to you.

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,766
What are the chances?
I don't know.

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,966
But shit happens
all the time.

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,485
This wasn't chance.

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,485
This was an act of God.

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,042
And we have been
invited into His circle

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,531
to lead this revolution.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
You haven't been
invited anywhere.

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,921
You forced yourself in.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,843
There's more
to your plan than this.

58
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,922
You're smart enough
to know that this hack alone

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,405
isn't gonna kill Evil Corp.

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,927
Once they realize
they can't recover the data,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,764
they'll figure out
a way to re-create it,

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,250
and that's where
you'll need me.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,801
Don't you
see it yet'?

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,891
From the first
time we met,

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,684
I felt something
between us.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,410
This is what I felt.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,289
An uncanny
connection, a bond.

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,600
We are meant
to work together.

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,205
That's what this
has all been about.

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,170
Work together? You're a psychopath.
How do I even trust you?

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,801
Pull the trigger again.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,002
I'll accept whatever
fate decides.

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,091
Pull it!

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,530
Okay, Looney Tunes.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,521
You're right.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,009
There is a second
stage to this.

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,007
After tonight,

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,443
I don't know what kind
of support I'll have.

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,926
I could use your help.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,407
Thank you, Elliot.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,081
I love...

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,561
Some things are
better left unsaid.

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,566
Subtext, you know?

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,201
Sit down.

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,847
Take this.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,683
You might just be
the perfect kind of crazy

87
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,921
who can protect me.
- .

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,487
From me.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,285
This his car?
Yes.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,846
What time did they arrive?

91
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,685
Shortly after 9:00 p.m.

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,483
This your first time
seeing the Swede'?

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,403
This Tyrell Wellick'?

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,087
YES.

95
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,610
What about the rest
of their crew?

96
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,442
Nope. No sign
of them.

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,244
All right, well...

98
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,527
Let's go.
You know the drill.

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,730
Let me monologue
a little first

100
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,242
and hold off
on showing the guns,

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,526
unless they get heroic.

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,321
Come on.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,765
How's that Pontiac
treating you?

104
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,205
Can't complain.

105
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,010
Yeah, well, I told you
she was reliable.

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,090
They'll spend a couple
weeks spinning their wheels,

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,766
trying to decrypt the data. Once
that fails, we'll try and collect

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,127
all the paper records
from the local town halls

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,690
and banks
across the country.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,570
Titles, deeds, loan records,
bank statements...

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,007
that's our target.

112
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,890
I know which
teams at E Corp

113
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,327
will be tasked with this
and their procedures.

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,563
I'm gonna assume by your funny
accent that you're Tyrell Wellick

115
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,921
Who the fuck are you?

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,687
I wouldn't.

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,888
Mr. Wellick, I'm gonna
need you to answer some questions.

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,725
Did anyone see you come here'?

119
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,401
Mr. Wellick?

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,290
Does anyone know
you're here now'?

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,401
No.

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,250
Is that
your SUV out there?

123
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,447
Yeah.

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,164
I'm gonna need the keys.
What the fuck is this?

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,129
I will get to you
in a moment.

126
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,804
Come on, Mr. Wellick.

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,201
My requests have
been pretty simple so far.

128
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,121
Phone, too.

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
Do you know
how to drive?

130
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,123
Yes or no question.
Yes.

131
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,810
Good. I'm gonna need you to
drive to, uh, 17th and 6th.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,926
Drop his car off
at the parking lot there.

133
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,604
Put this on the dash.
Go ahead.

134
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,688
And leave.
Make sure no one sees you.

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,240
And then go home
and lie low.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,082
Okay'? All right, Mr. Wellick,
come on. Let's go.

137
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
No one's going anywhere
until you tell me what...

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,489
If you're seeing me, that
means you boys fucked up.

139
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,050
Apparently, your friend,
James, E Corp IT, I believe...

140
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,881
After he completed
your honeypot request,

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,771
he contacted
a Gideon Goddard,

142
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,369
who reported
the incident to the FBI,

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,922
and then, well...

144
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,444
Do I really need
to go any further?

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,404
From what I understand, tonight
got a little sloppy joes,

146
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,209
if I'm being kind,
which I am.

147
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,367
And if I say no'?

148
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,841
Mr. Wellick,

149
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,730
pretty soon you're gonna be the
most wanted man in the world.

150
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,762
There will most likely
be a manhunt,

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,922
the likes of which we
haven't seen since bin Laden,

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,525
given what
you two did tonight.

153
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,969
Now, lam your only shot
at staying out of jail.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,082
But, hey, if you want to try to
make a go of it on your own,

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,241
well, that's on you.

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,931
I'll hightail it out of here

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,731
quicker than you can
finish a box of Swedish Fish.

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,206
You should go.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,650
How long do I
have to be here?

160
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,966
Not sure.

161
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,847
If you absolutely need
to contact your wife,

162
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,769
we have secure
ways of doing it.

163
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,089
Just give me
some time to work on it.

164
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,640
No. No contact.

165
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,925
If I'm gonna be here
for a while,

166
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,766
the more distance I create,
the-the better it is for me

167
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,120
the better
it is for her.

168
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,849
That's the only way I'm
gonna make it through this.

169
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,321
All right.

170
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,520
Well, I'll check in on you
every couple days,

171
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,641
make sure you're okay.

172
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,802
You're leaving? So what...
what about Elliot?

173
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,167
We have work to do.

174
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,645
I'm told that's
being worked on.

175
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,801
I'll need my gun back.

176
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,207
If I'm gonna be here alone,
I'll need protection.

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,931
We own 37 acres
of the surrounding property,

178
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,921
all enclosed
by ground sensors

179
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,281
and IR motion cameras,
wrought-iron gates.

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,010
This place is like
a chastity belt.

181
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,841
Nothing's gettin' in.

182
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,686
You want to be protected,
don't leave the property.

183
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,204
Elliot Alderson.
Are you Elliot Alderson?

184
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,565
Mr. Alderson, you're
under arrest

185
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,370
for unauthorized
use of a computer,

186
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,529
computer trespassing,
grand larceny...

187
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,883
<i>And I would be
the greatest job president,</i>

188
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,246
<i>ever, in my opinion.</i>

189
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,482
So, this is
your house.

190
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,084
One of your houses,
I assume.

191
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,485
I've never been
to this island.

192
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,168
You know, it doesn't
even show up on Google Maps.

193
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,642
You're going back
to New York in 22 minutes.

194
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,210
Well, Jesus Christ,
you could've called me

195
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,009
instead of putting me
on a four-hour flight.

196
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,801
I got a bad L4.

197
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,483
I need you to start an image
rehabilitation on Tyrell Wellick.

198
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,331
He's an ex-E Corp employee

199
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,402
who's about to be blamed
for the Five/Nine hack.

200
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,165
No matter how public it gets,

201
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,648
it is important that he stays
in a positive light.

202
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,244
Any chance Obama
goes after him?

203
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,528
People love to defend
anything he hates.

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,441
Also, there's a new narrative
I would like you to explore.

205
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,525
I need you to put fsociety's
origin on Iranian soil.

206
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,801
Iran, huh?

207
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,524
That's brown enough.
Shouldn't be too hard.

208
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,521
One last thing...

209
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,521
I may have a potential
candidate for president

210
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,806
I want you to back.

211
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,404
<i>Now, I've created
tens of thousands of jobs</i>

212
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,164
<i>over my career,
tens of thousands.</i>

213
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,691
Look, the country's desperate right now.
But you can't be serious.

214
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,926
I mean, the guy's
a buffoon.

215
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,525
He's completely divorced from reality.
How would you even control him?

216
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,528
If you pull
the right strings,

217
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,084
a puppet will dance
any way you desire.

218
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,561
<i>Right? Make America
great again.</i>

219
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,081
<i>I say it.</i>

220
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,881
<i>Max, he's interfering
with the resonator bomb.</i>

221
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,961
<i>Stop him!</i>

222
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,885
<i>I checked all the elevators,
Max, it's not here.</i>

223
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,288
<i>It's got to be. Keep looking.</i>

224
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,401
Mr. Wellick?

225
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,605
I'm Mr. Williams.

226
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,081
Please, come, come.
Have a seat.

227
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,282
Would you like some tea?

228
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,247
I brought Soderblandning
just for you.

229
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,767
No, I'm fine.

230
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,725
Are you comfortable here?

231
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,330
You have everything
you need?

232
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,961
No.

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,122
I've been here
four days by myself.

234
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,601
What's going on?
Where's Elliott?

235
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,526
Where Elliot is
is an interesting story,

236
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,571
and I've been tasked to come
here precisely for that reason

237
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,608
to explain it to you.

238
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,847
Please sit.

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,321
First,
I have a few questions.

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,288
We understand you
were working with Elliot...

241
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,081
On Stage 2
before your bad luck.

242
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,844
Is that correct?
Yes.

243
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,411
And we need
to get started on it.

244
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,086
E Corp might've already begun
the recovery program.

245
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,650
We need to start
our research.

246
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,609
We can't squander
our lead time like this.

247
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,365
Four days is already too long.
Yes, well...

248
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,611
before we commit
our resources to you,

249
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,561
I was sent here to confirm
your loyalty to our cause.

250
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,762
This is something we take
very seriously

251
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,808
if we're to work
with someone at this level.

252
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,444
You mean the Dark Army?

253
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,124
Of course, <i>I will</i>
be loyal to you.

254
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,089
You're our partners...
Did you kill Sharon Knowles'?

255
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,521
What?

256
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,211
Did you kill
Sharon Knowles?

257
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,527
I'm not sure I understand.
Don't look away.

258
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,642
Look at me. Did you
kill Sharon Knowles?

259
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,125
What does this have
to do with...

260
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,328
Did you kill Sharon Knowles'?
No.

261
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,404
Do you love your wife?
What is this?

262
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,284
Do you love your wife?
Of course, I do!

263
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,250
Have you slept with anyone else
since you've been married?

264
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,129
Don't look away.
Look at me.

265
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,443
Have you slept with anyone else
since you've been married?

266
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,483
No.
Will you be loyal to me?

267
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,131
Yes.
Were you fired from E Corp?

268
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,321
No, I quit.

269
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,641
Are you afraid
of becoming your father'?

270
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,721
What?

271
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,524
Do you hate your father?
No.

272
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,489
Will you be loyal to me?
Yes.

273
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,688
Did you murder
Sharon Knowles?

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,001
This is enough!

275
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,651
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
I said no!

276
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,846
Do you hate your father?
No.

277
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,251
Do you love your wife?
Of course I do.

278
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,446
Were you fired?
No.

279
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,124
Will you be loyal to me?
Yes!

280
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,403
Don't look away. Look at me.
Do you hate your father'?

281
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
Are you afraid
of becoming your father'?

282
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,841
This is enough.

283
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,445
Were you fired from E Corp?
This is enough!

284
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,686
Did you murder Sharon Knowles?

285
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,843
Will you be loyal to me?
Yes!

286
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,602
Have you slept
with anyone else

287
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,081
since you've been married?

288
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,929
Have you slept with anyone else
since you've been married?

289
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,361
YES.

290
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,203
Have you ever cheated
on your wife?

291
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,201
No.
Do you hate your father?

292
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,727
Yeah.

293
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,769
Were you fired
from E Corp?

294
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,281
Yeah.

295
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,086
Are you afraid
of becoming your father'?

296
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,001
YES.

297
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,802
Did you murder
Sharon Knowles?

298
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,961
Did you murder
Sharon Knowles?

299
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,081
Yes, yes, yes.

300
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,166
Will you be loyal to me?

301
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,531
No, I will not.

302
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,047
I will not.

303
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,329
But I will always
be loyal to Elliot.

304
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,524
You'll need to prep
Stage <i>2</i> from here

305
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,444
until we establish a more
permanent headquarters.

306
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,325
We'll get you everything you
need to begin reconnaissance.

307
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,086
<i>You'll receive
a phone and a laptop</i>

308
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,323
<i>with a VSAT to a satellite
that we control.</i>

309
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,882
Further instructions
will follow.

310
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,402
We're naming this op
Red Wheelbarrow.

311
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,243
It was Mr. Alderson's request.

312
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,842
But you still
haven't told me...

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,843
where is Elliot?

314
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,930
<i>You have a collect call
from an inmate</i>

315
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,843
<i>at the Queensboro
Correctional Facility.</i>

316
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,129
<i>This call will be recorded
and monitored.</i>

317
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,930
<i>Please press one to accept.</i>

318
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,441
Hello?

319
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,241
Is it really you?

320
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,921
<i>Who is this?</i>

321
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,530
Bonsoir, Elliot.

322
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,289
<i>“Death Likes It Hot“
by Gore Vidal. Chapter one.</i>

323
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,520
<i>The death of Peaches Sandoe,
the midget,</i>

324
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,080
<i>at the hands, or rather feet...</i>

325
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,281
<i>In the sideshow of the circus
at Madison Square Garden...</i>

326
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,646
You seem frustrated.

327
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,326
It was Elliot.
He was acting strange.

328
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,725
Doesn't exactly floor me.

329
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,285
Come outside with me
for a moment.

330
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,566
Get a firm stance.

331
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,727
Solid grip.

332
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,371
Swing through the log!

333
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,851
I need to get back to work.

334
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,846
You know,
if you're not careful,

335
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,009
you can lose your mind
up here alone.

336
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,369
This is the best way
to get you centered.

337
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,170
Balance is key.

338
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,205
Let me walk you
through another one.

339
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,605
I used to do it
as a child.

340
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,607
Why'd you ever stop?

341
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,566
Because I hated it.

342
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,241
Even better.

343
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,366
Here's the femtocell.

344
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,801
The malware's
already installed.

345
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,326
Just need you to mod it and do
your thing with the antennas.

346
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,523
Cool. I'll hit
this up tonight.

347
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,321
Tonight?

348
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,884
Try now, kid.
We're on a schedule.

349
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,928
We have some worrywarts
back at the house.

350
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,361
Training Angela for this hack
has been a hitch.

351
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,770
What's up?
You're acting weird.

352
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,083
You ever think about not
doing this shit anymore?

353
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,121
Just giving it up?

354
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,530
I mean, can't we
just be a normal couple

355
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,369
that complains
about the water bill

356
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,084
and looks up vacation
packages to... Budapest?

357
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,489
I knew I should've
never let you fuck me.

358
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,329
Okay.
I'm joking, dickface.

359
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,765
Look, we're in the eye
of a shitstorm,

360
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,410
and it ain't
slowing down right now.

361
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,641
But it will.

362
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,842
Maybe then
we can discuss Budapest.

363
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,930
She's antsy for it, so...

364
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,005
make sure you get it back
to me soon.

365
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,321
She's a job.

366
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,047
Always was.

367
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,169
If anything gets fucked up,
she's protected, you're not.

368
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,487
Why are you
telling me this'?

369
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,565
Stop caring
about her.

370
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,321
Trust me.

371
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,681
Bye.

372
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,250
That thing needs to go back
to the city, ASAP.

373
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,284
There's additional
code on here.

374
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,681
The Android malware... this has
nothing to do with our plan.

375
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,928
Why am I even discussing
this with you?

376
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,083
Elliot and I should be
working on this together.

377
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,766
If we were in the same room,
this would've been done.

378
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,201
Are you finished?

379
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,441
How you holding up'?

380
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,685
Thought this might
cheer you up.

381
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,445
Help remind you
of the old country.

382
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,801
Swedish Fish.

383
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,683
I take it you've read the news
of your wife's divorce.

384
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,327
Listen, don't believe
everything you read, okay'?

385
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,243
Those tabloids...
they're always full of shit.

386
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,923
Look how they almost ruined
Richard Gem's life,

387
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,331
and he's a damn
fine actor.

388
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
Primal Fear, am I right'?

389
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,563
"No one who's been emasculated
by crushing or cutting

390
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,128
may enter the assembly
of the Lord."

391
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,250
Deuteronomy 23:1.

392
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,967
Hey.

393
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,569
Thanks for getting
me the sunglasses.

394
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,203
Freeze! Don't move!
Let me see your hands.

395
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,329
Hands in the air, now!

396
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,080
Yep, I'm looking
at him right now.

397
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,681
Yes, sir.

398
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,649
I have the coordinates
plugged into my GPS.

399
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,881
I should be there
in about an hour.

400
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,481
Yes, sir. U-FAP.
We'll keep this on lockdown.

401
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,163
Okay, Mr. Wellick,
I need to let you know

402
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,242
that you're being
detained locally by me

403
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,243
from unlawful flight
to avoid prosecution.

404
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,371
I'll be transferring
you to FBI custody,

405
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,090
where you'll be
federally charged.

406
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,409
I can't believe it's actually
you. I just had a hunch.

407
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,001
Do you speak English?

408
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,922
You just got me
a promotion, you know that?

409
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,321
Before the FBI takes you away, I
got to get a selfie with you.

410
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,446
No one's gonna believe this.

411
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,361
You all right'?

412
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,801
Finally.

413
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,770
I was thinking you guys
were gonna send the cavalry.

414
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,006
You guys and your goddamn
cute puzzles.

415
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,165
I could've gotten here sooner if
you just gave me the address.

416
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,371
I had to solve a fucking
math problem to figure it out.

417
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,690
You're lucky
I covered the area

418
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,371
and made sure all the leads on
Wellick came directly to me.

419
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,286
But I wasn't planning
on killing a fucking cop.

420
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,201
What if he had called it in
to the local Barney Fife?

421
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,965
I mean, if you had
done your job...

422
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,324
You got to understand
where I'm coming from.

423
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,331
Now, lam getting
some serious heat at work,

424
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,611
which in my world
eventually leads to suspicion.

425
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,569
Suspicion because
of the events

426
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,766
you guys created.

427
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,043
I dodged a shootout in China.

428
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,126
That hasn't gone unnoticed.

429
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,371
Why was there a shootout?

430
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,245
Who the fuck knows?
Because your boss is a maniac.

431
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,524
And now,
with this FBI hack,

432
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,001
it's left us in a shitstorm
over Berenstain.

433
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,081
Shit happens.

434
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,444
Today wasn't our best day,
but we took care of it.

435
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,881
"We"?

436
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,761
I took care of it.

437
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,686
Yeah. Right.
I forgot.

438
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,925
You guys don't give
a shit about me.

439
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,648
Make sure this
doesn't happen again.

440
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,005
You fucking weirdo.

441
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,121
Hey, don't mind him.

442
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,130
He's a little snake. You know,
the kind of guy that will...

443
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,531
slice your throat
when you fart.

444
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,641
So...

445
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,325
you want to tell me
what that was all about,

446
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,401
running off like that?

447
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,163
You and I, our stories
aren't that different.

448
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,045
I'm not wanted
for the crime of the century.

449
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,606
I work a little
more subtly.

450
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,168
But we're both married
to our jobs...

451
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,529
Whether by nature
or by choice.

452
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,321
That said...

453
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,483
my boys were
everything to me.

454
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,290
Problem is,
I fucked up.

455
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,011
Took too long
to realize it.

456
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,484
And when my wife left me,
she took 'em.

457
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,285
What happened?
I was lost.

458
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,245
As lost as
you are right now.

459
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,211
And after chopping
a fuckload of wood myself,

460
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,687
I realized I needed them
in my life.

461
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,408
But I knew I had
to have a lot of patience.

462
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,005
And when the time
was right...

463
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,601
I was able to prove to my wife
that I was a good provider,

464
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,847
a good father,

465
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,521
a good man.

466
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,766
Now, tonight,

467
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,007
when I get home, my kids
are gonna run up and hug me.

468
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,366
We're gonna make Jiffy Pop and
watch <i>Big</i> Brother together.

469
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,489
When all is said
and done here,

470
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,407
you'll have your chance
to fix your situation.

471
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,930
And then your wife and son

472
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,330
will come running
up to greet you

473
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,004
at the end
of a long day's work.

474
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,490
My wife has to see me
as someone strong again.

475
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,446
She has to know
I will fix this.

476
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,925
But we have to get
this mission back on track.

477
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,681
And that can't happen

478
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,649
until Elliot and I
are reunited.

479
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,291
Give me a few more weeks,

480
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,406
and I promise...

481
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,647
you'll see him.

482
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,368
Couldn't close?
Nah, he walked.

483
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,927
What happened?

484
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,281
I'll tell you
what happened.

485
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,886
You couldn't
relate to him.

486
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,411
Take my thermos,
for example.

487
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,563
Yeah, so what? You
don't even have kids.

488
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,644
Point is, people
want a connection.

489
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,687
Makes you
more trustworthy.

490
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,049
You walk around with one of
these, and all of a sudden,

491
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,202
you're that corny guy
who's proud of being a father,

492
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,890
helps them buy
what you're selling.

493
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,810
Yeah. I'm gonna go in
for the night.

494
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,966
Next time,
make the sale.

495
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,011
<i>James, you are evicted
from the Big Brother House.</i>

496
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,321
<i>Should we make out?</i>

497
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,761
<i>It's been really fun.</i>

498
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,526
So how'd it go?

499
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,327
It was cool.

500
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,570
Got to stab up a bunch of
neo-Nazi motherfuckers to death.

501
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,168
You know, not that I'm a fan
of murderin' and shit,

502
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,049
'cause I respect life and all,

503
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,009
but when it come
to nee-Nazis...

504
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,647
Well, shit,

505
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,650
not gonna lie,
it was kind of fun.

506
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,284
I mean how'd it go
with Alderson?

507
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,761
Oh.

508
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,927
He got his papers.

509
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,927
Should be out soon.

510
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,683
By the way, get him laid
when he gets out, man.

511
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,721
Homeboy is wound tighter
than a chinchilla's asshole.

512
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,681
Go get packed.

513
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,726
He's being released.

514
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,322
It's perfect. He will love it.

515
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,002
Now, I'm giving this
back to you

516
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,521
for safe keeping.

517
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,447
The barrel was
jammed. Squib load.

518
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,126
Next shot would've blown
your hand clean off.

519
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,647
Lucky for you,
I took care of it.

520
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,288
<i>So this is how
the meet's gonna go down.</i>

521
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,001
<i>We've reached out to Elliot, and you
will be given further instructions</i>

522
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,923
<i>as soon as he makes contact.</i>

523
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,407
<i>Until then, we're gonna
need you to stay here</i>

524
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,489
<i>so you'll be near
the rendezvous point.</i>

525
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,043
<i>Now, you'll give
our driver the address.</i>

526
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,202
<i>He won't know where you're
going until you tell him.</i>

527
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,127
<i>If you get hungry,
just call for room service.</i>

528
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,608
Stay away from
the windows, okay?

529
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,122
We can't take any chances
now that we're in the city.

530
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,807
Okay.
Wait.

531
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,641
What about my suit?

532
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,924
Tyrell, we discussed this.
I need it.

533
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,331
It's nonnegotiable.

534
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,691
I have to look
my best for him.

535
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,440
It's in your closet.

536
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,247
I still strongly
advise against wearing it.

537
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,482
You know, this isn't
bumfuck nowhere.

538
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,168
You get picked up around here,
we can't protect you.

539
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,041
<i>Mr. Willick, it sounds like
someones here downstairs.</i>

540
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,361
I'll be right down.

541
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,644
You Elliot?
How do you know my name'?

542
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,361
No Elliot?

543
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,969
No, no, okay. Wait.

544
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,246
Chambers and Church.

545
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,811
We have to be careful now.

546
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,604
They said he's going
to be okay.

547
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,926
You need to sit down.

548
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,442
When he wakes up,
you shouldn't talk to him.

549
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,806
I will handle this.

550
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,560
He should be in a hospital.

551
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,485
The conditions here
aren't suitable.

552
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,961
It's...
He's in good hands.

553
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,041
I don't understand.

554
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,881
I don't understand.

555
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,043
He and I were
meant to be a team,

556
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,803
but he kept saying
I wasn't real.

557
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,086
He said he didn't see me, but I was
standing right in front of him.

558
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,161
We were talking.

559
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,649
So why would he say
I wasn't real, hmm?

560
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,730
I don't understand.
I just don't understand.

561
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,888
It was almost as if
he were a different person.

562
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,481
Tyrell...

563
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,085
He is...
Tyrell.

564
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,211
There's something that I need
to tell you about Elliot.

565
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,841
You're right.

566
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,727
He sometimes can become
a different person.
