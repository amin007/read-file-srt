1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,204
<i>71 buildings owned by
E Corp exploded or caught fire.</i>

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,611
<i>All those people who died.</i>

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,921
<i>They think the total
will be over 4,000.</i>

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,721
What are you doing?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,844
See? They all came back.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,771
<i>[thought
I would never win.</i>

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,969
<i>Not until I met Whiterose.</i>

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,685
Don't think for a second
that I don't know

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>that you're keeping
something from me.</i>

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,845
No, no, no.
Listen to me.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,809
You have to stop the attack!

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,531
Your wife's dead,
which means that your son

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,729
<i>is currently being raised
at Peaceful Acres Foster Care.</i>

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,050
If you're thinking about
telling anyone here about me,

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,805
<i>you won't live to place
a flower at your wife's grave.</i>

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,406
<i>But we still haven't
discussed the coltan mines.</i>

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,403
The fucking Congo can wait.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,404
It's time Phillip Price's hand
got slapped.

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,644
<i>If the UN approves
our annexation of the Congo,</i>

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,241
<i>we can finally move
our operation.</i>

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,523
My actions were never
meant to harm E Corp.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,840
Trust me' it will survive.

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,286
But I won't.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,648
Mr. Alderson can die for us,
just like his father.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,724
<i>Something ain't right about this guy.
I don't trust him.</i>

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,768
TRENTON; If what I discovered is
real, do you know what that means?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,889
We could potentially
undo this whole thing.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,161
If anything does happen to us,

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,005
I sent the e-mail to go out
automatically to someone I trust.

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,051
<i>Maybe there still are
things left for me to do.</i>

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,285
<i>Evil Corp is 80%
of our business.</i>

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,362
If we lose them,
it's gonna be it for us.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,442
It's gonna be it for me.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,529
Allsafe officially opened
its doors in '04.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,523
We have a relatively
small roster,

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,080
but that way our clients
have unprecedented access,

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,124
our undivided attention...

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,522
All those are standards
E Corp expects

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,806
from any vendor we hire.

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,122
Terry, please.

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,611
Let him continue.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,570
Allsafe has several
other clients

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,369
also in the Fortune 100.

44
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,091
And when called upon,
we help them out

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,642
in some pretty sticky
incident response scenarios.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,802
We'll be making a bit
of a splash next month

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,769
when we release
our 2012 report.

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,366
That's all teddy bears
and hand jobs,

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,411
but what are your financials?

50
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,610
We can't wake up one day
and find ourselves tits up,

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,045
dicks blowing in the breeze.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,566
Well, yes.
Of course, of course.

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,721
Thank you, Angela.

54
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,564
Hey, hon,
you want to top me off?

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,645
And add a pinch of Sweet'N
Low, but not too much.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,082
Angela, my assistant
can handle that. It's okay.

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,004
No, no. It's okay.

58
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,571
Regarding
our financials, Mr. Colby,

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,489
this will correspond
to page eight.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,130
Well, that was a cute
field trip, Phillip.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,525
Next time I waste
an afternoon, though,

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,931
I'd prefer a happy ending.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,641
Now what's the real
angle here'?

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,324
We headed to Legz & Lae
for happy hour?

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,526
We're gonna hire them.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,728
Set the deal in motion
immediately.

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,887
What... I...
I don't understand.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,162
Is there something bigger
behind the scenes here

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,651
we should know about, or...

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,643
I want the contract executed
as soon as possible.

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,569
Mr. Price, if I may...

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,322
I'm hesitant to depend
on Allsafe

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,482
as our security
operation center.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,563
I'm confident I could lead
a team

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,563
to establish our own
internal SOC.

76
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,880
And with the appropriate
resources...

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,765
I'm sorry, Mister, uh...

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,882
Wellick.
Wellick! Mr. Wellick!

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,925
I'm sorry if I misled you
into thinking that I was

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,004
seeking your counsel
or approval,

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,603
because I most certainly
am not.

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,007
Understood.
Good.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,048
Just hope it doesn't
come back to haunt us.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,809
This decision has been made.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,365
Remember
to alert the Bureau

86
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,930
if you're going to leave
the city, Mr. Wellick.

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,410
And no international travel
for now.

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,881
Mr. Robot.

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,881
<i>He took over again.</i>

90
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,366
<i>“They own the FBI. "</i>

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,970
<i>What is he trying to say?</i>

92
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,641
<i>Who's they?</i>

93
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,804
<i>Dark Army. It's gotta be.</i>

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,568
<i>Fuck, I left my machine
unlocked.</i>

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,207
<i>Trenton's e-mail.</i>

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,446
<i>Did he see this?</i>

97
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,963
<i>If he did, he knows
that Trenton was close</i>

98
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,008
<i>to finding a way
to undo Five/Nine,</i>

99
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,202
<i>and that I'm gonna finish
what she started.</i>

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,131
<i>He also looked up info
on Tyrell Wellick's release.</i>

101
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,487
<i>Why?</i>

102
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,320
<i>What exactly did Mr. Robot
do last night?</i>

103
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,606
Seventy-one buildings.

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,361
Was it worth it'?

105
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,565
Get the fuck out of my home.

106
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,843
Gotta <i>say,</i> your revised plan
was batshit insane.

107
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,282
It was supposed to be only one
building, but what you did...

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,566
I did what had to be done.

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,971
You mean
what they told you to do.

110
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,366
What'd they promise you, huh?
Money?

111
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,125
This isn't about them. This
is about when you fucked me!

112
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,970
I lost everything
because of you.

113
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,089
My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,801
Okay.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,967
Okay, I can't say that it's
all been smooth sailing,

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,166
but you gotta see
the big picture!

117
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,730
There is no big picture!

118
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,286
There was a job,
and I fulfilled my duty,

119
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,964
and that's more
than I can say for you.

120
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,326
Oh, come on.
You know damn well

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,925
that's not how
the Dark Army works.

122
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,407
You don't go from most wanted
man on the planet

123
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,925
to hero unless they have
plans for you,

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,081
how can you not see that?

125
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,322
The things I did,
the things I sacrificed,

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,686
I earned my freedom.

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,330
That's the least
they could give me.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,404
Horseshit. You're being added
to a collection of puppets.

129
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,403
No Puppet, no puppet.
You're the puppet!

130
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,087
Wake up! You made a deal with a
force that's bigger than you!

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,402
When the time comes,
they're gonna ask you to pay

132
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,130
what they feel you owe them!

133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,089
This is a childish conspiracy!

134
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,640
Childish? Who's the one
who said we were gods, huh?

135
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,644
Time to grow up.
There are no gods.

136
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,645
Our closest deities
are a society of the richest,

137
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,245
most influential men
in existence.

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,526
I'm done with this.
Men who

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,563
fuck over the rest of us
for profit,

140
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,166
for fun, and then leave us
in the streets for dead.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,965
Just like your Joanna!

142
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,404
You don't talk about my wife.

143
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,361
Wouldn't she want you to
realize the truth and fight?

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,488
Or would she want you
to be their little bitch?

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,928
There you go. Fight!

146
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,210
That's the Tyrell
who's been missing.

147
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,965
Now you want
to stop them, too,

148
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,485
before they put you
in that choke collar?

149
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,130
Unless you're into
that sort of thing.

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
What?

151
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,326
Oh, hello, sir.

152
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,121
May I come in'?

153
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,046
Oh, shit.

154
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,886
Didn't mean to interrupt.

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,290
Good evening, Mr. Alderson.

156
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,444
Please join us.

157
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,002
After all, you were a part
of this too.

158
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,962
<i>It's weird,
being here again.</i>

159
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,890
<i>Like we've come
to that slow glide</i>

160
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,610
<i>at the end
of a roller coaster.</i>

161
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,724
<i>We're coming full circle.</i>

162
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,881
<i>Darlene and Mr. Robot
started this whole thing,</i>

163
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,803
<i>and now she and I
are gonna end it.</i>

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,968
Trenton was investigating
Romero ever since

165
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,042
she found out he was
monitoring our machines.

166
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,326
This is big.

167
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,485
Why'd she send this to you?

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,845
I don't know.
If Trenton's right,

169
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,685
and encryption keys were exported
the night of the hack, then...

170
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,050
There's a chance we can
recover all of E Corp's data.

171
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,605
If we can find those keys.

172
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,770
Why would Romero do this?

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,804
There was never supposed
to be a Plan B,

174
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,211
that was the whole point.

175
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,487
This hack was supposed
to be all in.

176
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,847
He did it for the reason
we need those keys now,

177
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,410
in case our revolution failed.

178
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,369
We need access
to his keylogger files.

179
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,325
The feds confiscated
his drives.

180
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,370
Now all of his data is in the
FBI evidence storage system.

181
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,683
Sentinel, yeah,
I know it well.

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,481
That's why I'm here.

183
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,411
I need you to give me all the
intel you have about the FBI.

184
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,290
You do realize this isn't
Angela batting her lashes

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,805
at some feds to drop
a femtocell

186
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,211
at their E Corp office?

187
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,444
Sentinel is the Fort Knox
of closed networks.

188
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,931
And you want us to just
waltz in there and...

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,087
Not us.

190
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,725
Me. I'm gonna do it.

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,007
Did you not hear me?
You will get busted.

192
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,923
I don't care how good
you think you are.

193
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,528
The only way we do this
is if I go to them.

194
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,202
I'll hit up my contact...
We can't trust them.

195
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,529
The Dark Army owns the FBI.

196
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,604
How do you know that?
Doesn't matter.

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,809
Going to them isn't an option.

198
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,528
I might have an angle.
No, I told you...

199
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,887
I spent the last two months
working with the feds.

200
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,485
I know how they operate.

201
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,085
I'm miles ahead of you
on this.

202
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,525
Okay? I can do this.

203
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,241
What's your angle?

204
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,848
My angle is you trust me.

205
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,891
You gotta promise me.

206
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,169
Any sign of trouble,
you bail.

207
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,241
Even if we do this,

208
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,243
do you really think
it'll make a difference?

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,844
I mean the whole world
has gone to shit.

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,924
And we did that.
All we can do now is rebuild.

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,125
At least that's a start.

212
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,646
And the Dark Army?

213
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,682
You think they're just gonna be
painting each other's toenails

214
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,683
while we go and undo
everything they've worked for'?

215
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,728
You just worry
about getting into Sentinel.

216
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,604
Let me worry
about the Dark Army.

217
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,047
Believe me now'?

218
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,969
Lovely lady like you
with a Taurus?

219
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,804
I don't think so.
It's not a good fit.

220
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,527
But this baby, huh?

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,086
It's nice.

222
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,686
Bang a left up here.

223
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,646
I hear you're looking
to barter a TAG Heuer?

224
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,130
My ex-husband's.

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,126
I'm sure we can arrange
a deal.

226
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,283
And I really want to feel
you pump the gas here.

227
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,881
Let her open up.

228
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,764
Yeah?

229
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,604
Doesn't that feel good?

230
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,325
on.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,683
Is this supposed to...
I think it's dead.

232
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,161
You know what? Coast her to the
shoulder here on the left.

233
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
I'll check things out.

234
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,291
on board computer's so smart,
it probably senses something.

235
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,369
What are you doing?

236
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,681
You know what to do.

237
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,481
Tell you what,

238
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,089
why don't you stroll
on back to the lot,

239
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,931
peruse those Sonatas.

240
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,321
I'll meet you there
in a second.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,367
Go ahead.
I'm right behind you.

242
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,806
I called OnStar and the cops
are on their way,

243
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,486
so we don't have much time.
I need you to set a meet.

244
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,011
Look kid, I already told you,
we're done...

245
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,206
Stage 3.

246
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,044
What the fuck is Stage 3?

247
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,966
Just do what you do and set
the meet with Whiterose.

248
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,284
Since when do I take
orders from you?

249
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,845
If you don't move on this,

250
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,327
it'll be on you
to tell your employer

251
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,050
why you fucked
with their timeline.

252
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,127
Hey.

253
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,327
You're late.

254
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,570
I'm surprised you agreed
to meet.

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,650
Thought you weren't allowed
one on ones.

256
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,165
Technically you're not
a source anymore,

257
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,288
so I'll classify this
as a social meet.

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,248
But I suggest you get to the
point of why you called.

259
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,610
First, how about
a peace offering?

260
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,121
Shots?

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,043
You said you had something
to tell me.

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,882
So talk or this is over.

263
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,287
I've been thinking
about our last conversation.

264
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,451
Especially after...

265
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,209
Everything with Trenton
and Mobley,

266
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,009
and you were right.

267
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,768
There are things
I haven't told you.

268
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,606
I'm listening.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,571
Okay, well,
how does this work?

270
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,127
Is this off the record, or am
I fucking my own immunity?

271
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,441
Depends.

272
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,568
Everything you said,
you were on point.

273
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,769
Whiterose was behind
everything.

274
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,570
Five/Nine, the Dark Army
were our partners.

275
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,883
They handled the Chinese side,
we took care of it over here.

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,331
And Whiterose,
did you talk to him?

277
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,321
There was a middle man.

278
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,561
If the Dark Army was involved,

279
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,324
then Whiterose
had to greenlight it.

280
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,367
Would you be willing to go on
the record about what you know?

281
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,764
If I testified...

282
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,449
You know what the Dark Army's
capable of.

283
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,085
Darlene, you gotta
rethink this.

284
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,844
We can protect you,
we'll make things right.

285
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,686
Tyrell's walking free,
and your friends are dead.

286
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,806
Do it for them!

287
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,522
Fine. I gotta use
the bathroom.

288
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,206
Fuck...

289
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,806
<i>This is a reminder
that today's city-wide curfew</i>

290
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,803
<i>begins at 9:00 p.m.
this evening</i>

291
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,723
<i>through 4:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.</i>

292
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,724
<i>Stay indoors
and off the streets.</i>

293
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,080
<i>This is a reminder...</i>

294
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,207
This is proof.

295
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,121
It's finally happening.

296
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,082
We're going back
to the way things should be.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,804
Angela, I want to help you,

298
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,566
but you got to explain to me
what you think is happening.

299
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,691
I can't tell you that.

300
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,688
Only Whiterose can do that.

301
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,562
Whiterose manipulated you.

302
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,242
She exploited your feelings
about your mom,

303
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,482
and used them against you.
That's what she does.

304
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,961
I thought that you wanted
our parents back.

305
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,922
That's never going to happen.

306
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,047
That's because you don't
understand.

307
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,766
We can't talk here.

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,810
There are people
that are trying to stop this.

309
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,801
Let's go inside.

310
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,444
I know this may sound
like bullshit,

311
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,330
but I'm sorry I was such
a pain in the ass.

312
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,366
The pressure of trying to find
Tyrell and lying to my brother

313
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,961
and secluding myself in that apartment,
just feeling lonely as shit,

314
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,206
I guess it was just too much.

315
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,245
So this is my long-winded
way of saying I don't think

316
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,163
I have it in me to testify.

317
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,048
Maybe I'm not as cool
and collected as I put on.

318
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,370
I get the front you put up.

319
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,885
It's a trick I use myself.

320
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,887
You are an FBI agent,

321
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,884
yet somehow I feel like you're
the only one I can trust.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,331
Maybe that's because you can.

323
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,963
Yeah. Maybe so.

324
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,127
Okay, well' I hope
the intel helped.

325
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,601
Sorry I couldn't do more.

326
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,841
You're leaving?

327
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,201
Thanks for the drink,
and for listening.

328
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,723
Wait, you want another?

329
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,807
On me?

330
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,166
So you still single?

331
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,205
Wow!

332
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,568
Jumping right into
this conversation again.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,606
Haven't you learned my social
game isn't my strong suit?

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,486
Well, I'm willing to bet you've
got some untapped talent.

335
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,847
What's your type?

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,131
Where are you going with this?

337
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,962
Well, I am one hell
of a wingwoman, okay?

338
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,566
So let's pick you out one
of these lovelies here.

339
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,926
What about that Ginger?

340
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,931
What, are you not into fire
crotch? Hypocrite.

341
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,521
Dye job.

342
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,007
Fine.

343
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,964
Goth hipster in the corner?

344
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,766
Identity issues.

345
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,129
Oh, okay.

346
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,603
Ooh, what about that?

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,731
Oh, my God. Barkeep!
Another round.

348
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,041
'Sup, cuz?

349
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,604
Oh, shit. Sorry, dude.

350
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,763
Don't let me interrupt
your flow or anything,

351
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,451
I mean I didn't know
you had a female caller.

352
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,246
Who's he?

353
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,923
This is why you're asking
about our plan, isn't it?

354
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,806
Angela.

355
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,205
You've been trying to listen
to me, haven't you'?

356
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,647
Did you hear me?

357
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,531
Did you hear
what we were saying out there?

358
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,251
I've just been sitting here,
smoking these trees, girl.

359
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,081
I don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

360
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,085
You're trying to trap me.

361
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,687
Aren't you?

362
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,966
Angela.

363
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,326
You have to leave.

364
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,562
Get out now, trust me.

365
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,811
You've been trying
to trick me.

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,083
That's why you wanted me
to explain everything.

367
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,969
It's you who's trying to stop
our plan.

368
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,483
I thought you were on my side.

369
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,450
Dude,
your girl's trippin'.

370
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,762
Look, I don't know
what you guys got going on,

371
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,921
and I'm sorry, sweetheart,

372
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,401
but we really ain't
got the time right now.

373
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,445
We got business to attend to,
and she... She gotta go, bro.

374
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,606
One way or another.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

375
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,802
You're not going to get any
more information out of me.

376
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,931
Slow your roll, cuz.

377
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,327
We gotta get.

378
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,203
We got a tight schedule
to maintain.

379
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,609
I am here mainly
as a formality, Wellick,

380
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,044
to fake a smile and pretend
to welcome you back.

381
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,526
You have been appointed
CTO at E Corp.

382
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,405
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

383
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,405
You coming here personally...
Yes, yes. Right, right.

384
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,962
But the direct purpose
of my visit...

385
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,287
I felt it was important
to share with you formally

386
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,570
that the CTO title
is nothing more than that.

387
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,604
You are a mere figurehead
I inherited

388
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,923
from a deal gone wrong.

389
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,726
It happens from time to time.

390
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,926
But I wanted you to understand
the nature of your position

391
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,244
in case you should have
loftier designs.

392
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,645
There'll be none of that.

393
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,042
Obedience will be your only
task at my company.

394
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,407
I worry that could potentially
get awkward

395
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,131
if you thought differently,

396
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,403
so I came here out of respect.

397
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,124
By your silence, I assume
you accept this position?

398
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,200
I know what this is.

399
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,402
You're embarrassed
that you fired me.

400
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,011
There's no shame
in admitting the truth.

401
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,245
You're out of moves
and your company needs me.

402
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,362
E Corp needs my image,
the face of a hero.

403
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,085
That's why you're here.

404
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,364
On, Wellick, Wellick.

405
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,283
It's not that I'm out
of moves.

406
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,490
Its that you're not
worth one.

407
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,163
See you at the office, mm?

408
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,324
Five/Nine, fsociety.

409
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,929
You knew the entire time,
didn't you?

410
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,241
Five/Nine, yes.

411
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,524
Well, not all the minutiae,
of course.

412
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,170
But since the cyber bombings,

413
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,007
the breadcrumbs haven't been
that difficult to follow.

414
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,966
World catastrophes like this,

415
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,922
they aren't caused
by lone wolves like you.

416
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,609
They occur because men
like me allow them.

417
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,521
You just happened
to stumble into one of them.

418
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,281
No, no. I ran the operation.
I pushed the button.

419
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,283
I am the one...
There you go again.

420
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,442
"I, I, I..."

421
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,082
You're still thinking
like alone wolf.

422
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,563
Why don't you tell me
how I should be thinking?

423
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,205
Like a leader!

424
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,050
I am a leader!

425
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,925
Then where are your followers?

426
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,646
You can't force an agenda,
Mr. Alderson.

427
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,089
You have to inspire one.

428
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,528
Nice digs.

429
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,125
DiPIERRO: Remember,
I only let you in

430
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,850
because you said
you're not into girls.

431
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,325
No, I said I wasn't a lesbian,
end quote.

432
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,289
I didn't say
I wasn't into girls.

433
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,647
Very clever.

434
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,721
How about that nightcap?

435
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,606
Right, but only one.

436
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,170
I gotta work in the morning,

437
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,130
and you gotta get home
before curfew.

438
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,881
Screw curfew.

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,161
Hey, that rhymes.

440
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,281
An E Kit?

441
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,201
God, I can't believe
you bought into that shit.

442
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,890
You can never be too prepared.

443
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,366
Such a Girl Scout.

444
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,970
You think that's Girl Scout-y?

445
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,770
Mmm-hmm.
Check this out.

446
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,449
Alexa, give me the daily
Five/Nine.

447
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,521
Hello,

448
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,967
<i>and welcome to your daily
Five/Nine report.</i>

449
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,364
<i>Officials advise to stay away
from the Upper East Side,</i>

450
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,722
<i>where armed theft
is at peak levels.</i>

451
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,681
Impressive.

452
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,931
What else does that thing do?

453
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,165
Alexa, play John Prine.

454
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,962
<i>Shuffling songs
by John Prine.</i>

455
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,647
That's better.

456
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,124
Why you didn't go after
that blonde is beyond me.

457
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,722
She was mint.
Wasn't meant to be.

458
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,528
Whatevs. You didn't even try.

459
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,250
Jesus H., I think I'm drunk.

460
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,481
But it's...

461
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,846
Probably a good thing, 'cause I
have like legit trouble sleeping.

462
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,922
I take melatonin, but I gotta
down, like, six of them

463
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,201
to even get drowsy,
and then...

464
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,087
What was that?

465
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,364
It's cool.
No, it's...

466
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,726
No, it's not.

467
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,803
What am I doing?
This isn't professional.

468
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,085
Dude, you said it yourself.
I'm not a source anymore.

469
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,730
Believe it or not,
I'm actually a real person.

470
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,320
Darlene, seriously.
All right.

471
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,686
Fine. I'm sorry,
it's just...

472
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,647
<i>I</i> like you.

473
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,087
You're drunk.

474
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,202
Come on, at least give
me more credit than that.

475
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,484
Wait, hold on.

476
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,446
Um, one second.

477
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,966
You could've kept the gun on.

478
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,891
Don't overthink this.

479
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,686
We have to get moving.

480
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,721
We're not safe here.

481
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,731
I have to warn her. She has
to know what they heard.

482
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,001
I could just get
on the subway,

483
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,242
she'll find us like before.
She'll protect us.

484
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,846
<i>Since the cyber bombings,</i>

485
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,161
<i>there's been a wave
of backlash against the FBI</i>

486
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,323
<i>from Americans of all backgrounds
and political views.</i>

487
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,364
<i>The one thing we heard over
and over from those...</i>

488
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,526
<i>was the sentiment that our law
enforcement agencies</i>

489
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,364
<i>can no longer be trusted.</i>

490
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,366
You ready?

491
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,369
Yo, Dr. Wang.
How you doing?

492
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,284
And this is where
we part ways.

493
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,721
Peace, brother.

494
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,441
Your bag.

495
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,169
Where we going?
Shut the fuck up.

496
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,401
No questions.

497
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,804
I hear you have some
information on Stage 3.

498
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,487
I need my laptop.
It has my plans.

499
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,287
It's fine.

500
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,928
We can pull everything
we need from there.

501
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,970
Why don't you have a seat?

502
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,881
Your password?

503
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,327
The first time you and I met
to discuss the E Corp hack,

504
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,886
you said this was
a two-step plan.

505
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,971
So I'm sure you can imagine
my surprise

506
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,247
when out of the blue,

507
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,080
I now hear there is a third.

508
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,325
So, Mr. Alderson, why don't you
tell me what it is you want?

509
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,888
I asked for a meet
with Whiterose.

510
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,042
I'll relay any messages
to her.

511
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,529
I need to speak with her
directly.

512
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,843
You've had all the time you'll
ever get with Whiterose.

513
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,002
I thought she wanted
to kill E Corp.

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,010
Yes, I believe
that's what we did.

515
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,730
No, E Coin didn't exist

516
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,484
when we first created
this plan.

517
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,321
Now it's the only thing
keeping them afloat.

518
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,004
It's becoming the world
standard.

519
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,889
And E Cam's entire existence
relies upon it.

520
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,524
So what do you propose we do?

521
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,245
If you truly want to end them,

522
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,527
eliminating E Coin
is the only way.

523
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,971
Mr. Alderson,
is this everything

524
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,929
that you came
to discuss with me?

525
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,207
Anything else on your mind?

526
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,651
Are you in or out?

527
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,764
Goodbye, Mr. Alderson.

528
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,728
I got CDs,
everybody, come on!

529
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,880
They get you turnt!

530
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,247
Scan me .05 E Coin,
it's yours!

531
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,691
I got CDs! CDs! Yo,
this shit'll get you turnt!

532
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,050
All right, scan me .05 E Coin,
and it's yours!

533
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,164
Hey, these savage
tracks will give you life, yo.

534
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,047
No.

535
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,842
I will not take your CD
this time.

536
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,361
<i>Ms. Moss?</i>

537
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,083
Ms. Moss, I'm gonna need you
to come with us.

538
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,800
CDs! CDs!

539
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,690
This shit'll get you turnt!

540
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,561
Scan me .05 E Coin,
and it's yours!

541
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,761
We're ready.

542
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,490
So this is why you came here.

543
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,364
You're not talking your way
out of this.

544
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,361
Well, you were right.

545
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,848
Everything we did
was what they wanted.

546
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,201
Exactly.

547
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,850
Whiterose, Price, and who
the fuck knows who else?

548
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,522
I'm a prisoner
just like before.

549
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,401
Where does that leave me?
What am I supposed to do?

550
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,047
The CTO position is worthless.
You heard him.

551
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,326
We can use it.

552
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,571
You see how they operate?
In the shadows.

553
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,527
You just settle in,
smile, nod.

554
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,765
When the time is right...

555
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,406
we'll expose them.

556
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,041
Do you get it now?

557
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,408
E Corp, they might as well
be a front for them!

558
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,890
Whiterose, Price,
their friends,

559
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,369
they're the ones
we need to take down.

560
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,524
We just need a launching pad.

561
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,401
A place to begin, dig in.

562
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,684
Find that vulnerability.

563
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,880
The FBI.

564
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,047
The Dark Army has a man
on the inside.

565
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,611
I don't understand.
How do you not understand'?

566
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,011
You were trying to hack me.
An FBI agent.

567
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,320
And I already told you why.

568
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,726
Your bullshit's not gonna fly!

569
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,801
SANTIAGO; Enough!

570
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,001
You gonna fill me in?

571
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,761
Tell him.

572
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,201
Get fucked.

573
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,362
Every time you guys get intel,

574
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,124
one of my friends
ends up dead.

575
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,684
And Tyrell's bullshit release

576
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,808
was as pathetic
as a dry hand job.

577
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,168
Why should I trust you
or anyone else here?

578
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,284
The FBI is obviously
in bed with the Dark Army.

579
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,167
Where'd you hear that'?

580
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,441
Chew balls.

581
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,761
Just tell me.

582
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,481
Why is she here?

583
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,889
She was in my home, attempting to
steal my badge to get on Sentinel.

584
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,330
Full disclosure, Sir,
we had relations tonight.

585
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,811
I plan on self-reporting it
to the OPR.

586
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,530
I'm not keeping anything
from the Bureau.

587
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,010
Do you have any idea how fucking
big the crime you committed is?

588
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,043
You can forget about immunity
this time.

589
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,851
And why the hell were you trying
to get into Sentinel anyway?

590
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,004
You're in too deep
this time, Darlene.

591
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,881
You gotta talk.

592
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,250
There are files in Sentinel
that can help decrypt

593
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,845
all of E Corp's data.

594
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,764
That means bringing
everything back.

595
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,286
The solution to undoing
Five/Nine is in a machine

596
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,601
on the other side
of this floor, okay'?

597
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,523
They're in Romero's
collection.

598
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,326
Sit with me,
look over my shoulder,

599
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,846
I'll even walk through it
with your engineer, whatever.

600
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,888
You guys can personally
take the keys to E Corp

601
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,884
and be the heroes, okay?
You can fix everything.

602
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,325
Isn't that
what you want?

603
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,731
What you've been waiting for?

604
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,127
She's right! Wasn't this the
point of our entire strategy?

605
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,247
You need to understand
something...

606
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,049
This is the opportunity
we've been chasing!

607
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,327
You're missing the point.
We have nothing to lose.

608
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,842
If she's lying, we put her
in jail, but if she's not...

609
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,445
And what if our testimony
gets thrown out

610
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,807
because of your grossly
unprofessional behavior?

611
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,691
Sleeping with a CHS,
for Christ's sake.

612
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,250
She's not a CHS anymore.

613
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,129
And you know
I didn't break any rules.

614
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,651
So what's really
happening here?

615
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,771
Why not take her up
on her offer?

616
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,684
Get back to your desk
and write the 302

617
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,286
explaining your actions
minute by minute.

618
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,929
I'm assigning Agent Kaz
to Darlene.

619
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,009
<i>That will continue to be
part of the debate...</i>

620
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,367
What's the plan here? She talks
like she knows everything.

621
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,249
<i>You sound stressed.</i>

622
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,402
Of course, I'm fucking
stressed. I could be burnt.

623
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,923
Meanwhile, she claims
she can undo the hack.

624
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,251
And where is she now?

625
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,049
Locked in a goddamn
interview room.

626
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,841
Okay.

627
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,809
Is that all you've got?
"Okay"?

628
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,841
<i>Jesus, will you just tell
me how do you want to proceed?</i>

629
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,849
Not one box even packed?

630
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,567
I suppose there's some banal
excuse why a month

631
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,244
isn't enough time
for those lazy mules

632
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,163
to get my project shipped
to the Congo?

633
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,811
Border security.

634
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,731
Border security
across the Eastern seaboard

635
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,246
is restricted to levels
we've never seen before.

636
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,641
Hence, our extensive payroll.

637
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,641
We own mayors,
district attorneys,

638
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,326
governors, fucking presidents!

639
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,005
The country is
operating under martial law.

640
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,448
Our contacts are afraid.

641
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,291
You've always asked
that I be honest with you.

642
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,447
Speak.

643
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,765
This is your fault.

644
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,807
You blindly indulge all
of Elliot Alderson's whims.

645
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,963
And it has landed us here.

646
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,845
If you'd listened to me,

647
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,401
if you believed in my strategy
as much as you did his,

648
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,409
we could have avoided this.

649
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,209
We had the U.N. vote, these
attacks weren't necessary.

650
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,569
People like Phillip Price
do not respect mercy.

651
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,731
You only get their attention
with force and a lot of it.

652
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,923
That is the only currency
with these men.

653
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,729
I will go back to our partners

654
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,088
with a more persuasive
argument.

655
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,611
See? That's all
I needed to hear.

656
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,847
And...

657
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,206
What HOW?

658
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,046
<i>I keep looking at this note,</i>

659
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,566
<i>wondering what Mr. Robot
did last night.</i>

660
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,488
<i>If the Dark Army
does own the FBI,</i>

661
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,326
<i>how did he find out?</i>

662
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,481
<i>Does it matter?
I don't need him.</i>

663
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,006
<i>Darlene will be checking
in soon about Sentinel,</i>

664
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,328
<i>and I have to enact Stage 3.</i>

665
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,723
Mr. Alderson is claiming
there is a third stage.

666
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,648
He wants to target E Coin.

667
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,161
<i>But I'm sure you knew
all along there is no Stage 3.</i>

668
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,087
<i>A third</i> stage.
Odd.

669
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,885
That wasn't part of our
original plan, was it'?

670
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,047
NO.

671
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,810
So what do you make of that?

672
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,089
His sister is currently
being held at the FBI.

673
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,847
<i>Claiming she can
decrypt E Cam's data.</i>

674
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,005
I can't help but notice
their actions are incongruous.

675
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,410
He's lying to us.

676
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,251
I don't think their target
is E Corp anymore.

677
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,680
I think it's us.

678
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,803
<i>When the Dark Army
operatives' malware</i>

679
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,770
<i>copies my file to their
command and control server...</i>

680
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,886
Get yourself back to work.

681
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,005
<i>It'll be queued up
for an operator</i>

682
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,650
<i>to review its contents.</i>

683
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,763
<i>Once opened, my exploit
will give me full access</i>

684
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,490
<i>to their management interface.</i>

685
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,726
Why the dismay?

686
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,924
We expected something like
this out of him, did we not?

687
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,647
You never understood
my commitment to Mr. Alderson.

688
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,366
You say that I was wrong
to order the attack.

689
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,768
Maybe I'm wrong
about him as well.

690
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,526
So tell me,

691
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,009
what would you do
if you had your way?

692
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,763
<i>And now,
1 own the Dark Army.</i>

693
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,443
Do you remember when you said

694
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,003
Elliot will one day follow in
the footsteps of his father'?

695
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,610
I think it's time
he died for us, too.
