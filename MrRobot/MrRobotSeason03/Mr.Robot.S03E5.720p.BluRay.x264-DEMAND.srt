1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,161
Anything we do,
he will try to slow us down.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,766
<i>As long as he exists,
he will stop us.</i>

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,526
<i>Today is the day
I start working at Evil Corp.</i>

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>I can help them rebuild the database
and defend the fort at the same time.</i>

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,809
<i>This patch ensures that the UPS
devices will only run trusted code.</i>

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,929
<i>Bottom line, they won't be
able to blow up that building.</i>

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,771
U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,320
but this currency war
must end.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,927
Stage <i>2,</i> I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,570
<i>Protesters have
surrounded the building.</i>

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,405
Summon as much
NYPD as is necessary.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,369
You know that telling Elliot
anything about this

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,044
would violate the terms
of your immunity?

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,566
I think I have a lead,
but I need to go at it alone.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,962
<i>I may have immunity,
but I'm gonna lose my brother.</i>

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,565
Stage 2 was never
called off.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,201
How do we find them and just
end this once and for all?

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,282
<i>The best lead
we've got is me.</i>

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,371
Irving, he says we'll be
ready to go on Monday.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,568
We've prepared
for an emergency evacuation.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,641
<i>We have'?</i>

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,609
I'll have Elliot's
access revoked.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,330
I need you to fire
Elliot Alderson.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,526
Consider it done.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,601
YOU Okay?

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,085
What's happening?
Angela, why is he here?

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,241
Everything's gonna be okay.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,766
<i>Elliot saw everything.
I had to knock him out.</i>

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,291
You're staying here
this weekend.

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,885
We can't have
anymore accidents.

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,121
He's gonna wake up again.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,084
<i>He only saw us
for a few seconds.</i>

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,491
<i>Maybe he won't remember.</i>

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,369
...to replace
the Syrian President.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,205
<i>But Putin's stance
is that it would be a mistake</i>

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,009
<i>to abandon
the current government.</i>

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,605
<i>Meanwhile, the U.N. Security
Council has gathered today</i>

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,603
<i>for a much talked about vote,</i>

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,042
<i>the People's Republic
of China's proposed annexation</i>

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
<i>of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.</i>

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,088
<i>As the world awaits
the result of the vote,</i>

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,969
<i>many questions
are being raised.</i>

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,048
<i>What does it mean for the
relationships </i>

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,930
<i>between world superpowers
and impoverished nations?</i>

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,201
ANGELA; Elliot?

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,686
Isn't that your phone?

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,921
Is it?

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,446
Are you okay?

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,645
Yeah, I'm fine.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,921
Hello?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,843
<i>Finally, I've been
trying to reach you all weekend.</i>

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,921
<i>Are you at work?</i>

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,128
<i>Yeah.
Don't go anywhere.</i>

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,488
<i>We need to talk, in person.</i>

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,843
<i>Meet me downstairs.
I'll be there in ten.</i>

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,650
Okay? It's...
It's important.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,040
Is everything okay?

58
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,971
Everything's fine.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,761
He)”

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
We should grab lunch later.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,366
<i>Something isn't right.</i>

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,124
<i>Like something slipped
away from me.</i>

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,607
<i>What is it?</i>

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,650
<i>I can't put my finger on it.</i>

65
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,685
<i>What am I even doing here?</i>

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,362
<i>I'm arriving at work.
I'm walking toward my cubicle.</i>

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,650
<i>I'm just on autopilot,</i>

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,521
<i>running my routine.</i>

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,844
<i>Did my daily program crash?</i>

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
<i>When code runs,
it should run</i>

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,690
<i>straight through
without interruption,</i>

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,801
<i>until all of its tasks
have been completed.</i>

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,205
<i>Unless something goes wrong.</i>

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,927
<i>A runtime error.</i>

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,602
<i>Sometimes, corrupted memory
can lead to one.</i>

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,403
<i>Is that what's happening
to me right now?</i>

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,041
<i>A runtime error?</i>

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,770
Yo, what up, E?

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,321
I barely made it past
those protesters this morning.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,249
I mean, the natives
are getting restless.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,568
This shit's crazy AF, right'?

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,041
Is it?

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,641
Hey, so I had a piece
of tang this weekend

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,449
you are not gonna
believe, dude.

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,568
I was unlocking achievements
Saturday night

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,483
that went all the way through
to Sunday morning.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,411
I even impressed myself.

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,402
Every morning starts like
this, graphic sex talk.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,161
Thankfully, I'm able
to tune most of it out.

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,042
When people talk like this,
they're either insecure,

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,251
or they're full of shame.

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,765
Which one
do you think it is'?

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,646
L, uh...

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,927
Sorry.

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,488
<i>Shit.
That was meant for you.</i>

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,606
<i>I'm really off today.</i>

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,404
I mean...

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,764
Jesus, Elliot, I, um...

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,681
You know what, man?
Fuck you.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,726
I'm just trying
to brighten up your day

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,245
with my dope-ass anecdotes,

102
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,529
but if you don't appreciate it,
I can just sit here in silence.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,721
Really?

104
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,161
<i>Is this gonna end up being
a beautiful accident?</i>

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,086
No, I'm...

106
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,046
I'm sorry, bro.
I shouldn't have said that.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,326
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,006
I'm bigger than this, man,
and, in a way,

109
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,809
what you just said
actually helps me,

110
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,484
'cause I've always wondered

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,881
if people here thought I was
just trying to get attention,

112
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,246
but I was like, "Nah."

113
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,125
But I should've
started the day off

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,929
by asking what you did
this weekend.

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,770
<i>He does raise
a good question.</i>

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>What did I do this weekend?</i>

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,168
Instead, I'm always just
rambling around some bullshit.

118
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,960
But you know what, I'm gonna
drop some truth on you, dude.

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,487
Since we're opening up here,
I, uh...

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,969
I've only ever gotten
laid twice.

121
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,284
Okay, actually, it was one and half
times, but the first time, it <i>was...</i>

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
it was one of those high-end
escorts, dude, a courtesan.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,526
I saw her at the Plaza Hotel.
Actually, she saw me, dude.

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,090
She totally was hitting on me.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,244
It cost me, like,
two weeks' pay.

126
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,368
<i>Oh, I know
what I did this weekend.</i>

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,125
<i>I rehearsed my proposal.</i>

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,840
<i>I have a big meeting
with the VP of Technology.</i>

129
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,491
I've actually never had penetration, dude.
I've never penetrated. I just...

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,526
I went to one of those
rub and tugs...

131
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,046
<i>No, wait,
I already had that meeting.</i>

132
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,766
<i>That was last week.</i>

133
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,966
<i>What happened
this past weekend?</i>

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,087
I just kept thinking
she was one of those girls

135
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,168
that got kidnapped
and was forced to do it.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,004
I was, like, thinking
of her family the whole...

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,730
Hey, dude, thanks
for letting me confide in you.

138
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,368
Just don't tell any
of the guys about this. Cool?

139
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,530
<i>It's hard what he just did.</i>

140
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,130
<i>Opening up face-to-face,</i>

141
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,204
<i>which is why
I probably talk to you.</i>

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,285
<i>Why is my account locked out?</i>

143
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,761
<i>E Corp Help Desk.</i>

144
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,285
Hey, I got locked out
of my account.

145
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,044
Can you do a password
reset for me?

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,605
<i>Can I have
your employee number?</i>

147
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,404
0-7-2-3-9-1.

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,721
Please hold.

149
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,407
<i>My work email is
prompting me for a password.</i>

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,644
<i>Did someone try to get on the
domain as me too many times?</i>

151
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,484
<i>Or has E Corp locked me out?</i>

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,330
<i>Did they discover
my shipping hack?</i>

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,324
<i>I need to check
my monitoring server.</i>

154
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,603
Hey, Samar...
Samar, I got locked out.

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,928
Can I hop on your machine
to check something real quick?

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,286
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
go for it.

157
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,048
Yeah, dude no.
There's no way she...

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,411
<i>Is this that bad feeling
I have looming over me?</i>

159
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,602
<i>Is this why today
doesn't feel right?</i>

160
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,046
<i>An update failure.</i>

161
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,569
<i>No, this can't be happening.</i>

162
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,203
<i>Maybe something's wrong
with my dashboard.</i>

163
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,930
<i>I need to check the full log.</i>

164
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,881
<i>Shit. This morning
at 6:07 a.m.,</i>

165
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,962
<i>the Dark Army tried
to run Stage 2.</i>

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,765
<i>My patch stopped them,
but it doesn't change the fact</i>

167
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,161
<i>they're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.</i>

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,323
Damn, dude, Bobbi from
HR is rolling up with Security.

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,926
Wonder who they're axing.

170
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,801
<i>Mr. Alderson,
thank you for waiting.</i>

171
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,167
<i>I looked into this.</i>

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,686
<i>It looks like we cannot restore
your account at this time.</i>

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,401
<i>Is there anything else
I can...</i>

174
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>Samar is right.
HR is firing someone.</i>

175
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,162
<i>Me. Fuck...</i>

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,522
<i>I can't leave the building
until I get back on a machine</i>

177
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,171
<i>and figure out how they're planning
on getting around my patch.</i>

178
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,808
Samar, I need you
to distract them for me.

179
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,961
Wait, what?

180
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,246
<i>Help me figure this out.</i>

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,922
<i>Do not leave me.
Stay focused.</i>

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,611
Excuse me,
I had a question for you...

183
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,444
We're looking for Elliot Alderson.
Do you know where he is?

184
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,170
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he's on floor 11.

185
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,366
You know, they have
the best bathrooms,

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,011
and he likes to take his
morning dump around this time.

187
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,208
Samar, you need
to be serious right now.

188
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,203
We have talked about these
micro-aggressions of yours.

189
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,089
I am being serious.
He told me he was crowning

190
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,366
his whole commute.
He was just here.

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,930
We need eyes
on Elliot Alderson.

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,605
Elliot, I didn't know
if you'd be here.

193
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,170
Janet, I... Great news
on your proposal.

194
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,924
Starting with the Southwest
region this week,

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,128
all paper records
will be digitized locally.

196
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,806
I tried to find you on Friday.
You weren't in.

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,644
I wanted to congratulate
you in person.

198
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,081
Before we know it,
the database...

199
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,321
<i>Did you hear
what she said?</i>

200
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,165
<i>I wasn't in Friday.
Where was I?</i>

201
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,570
<i>When did my program halt?
Why can't I remember? Wait...</i>

202
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,325
Mr. Robot...
Mr. what?

203
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,561
What day is it today?

204
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,005
You know it's gonna be
a long week

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,003
if you gotta ask on a Monday.
Is everything all right?

206
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
Janet, I can't
talk right now.

207
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,402
There's an I.T.
emergency on 29.

208
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,567
<i>Last thing I remember
was the E Corp party.</i>

209
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,206
<i>That was four days ago.</i>

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,926
<i>Did Mr. Robot really
take over for that long?</i>

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,084
<i>Don't look up.
Security cameras.</i>

212
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,241
<i>That's right. Darlene.
I remember now.</i>

213
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,368
<i>She was supposed
to follow me... Him.</i>

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,931
<i>You know what I fucking mean.</i>

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,729
<i>She must've seen Mr. Robot.</i>

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,450
Darlene.
I can barely hear you.

217
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,524
<i>It's a madhouse down here.
You were gone all weekend.</i>

218
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,841
<i>You left Flipper alone. I had
to give him to your landlord.</i>

219
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,526
Listen to me. Did you follow me?
Did you see him?

220
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,284
<i>Okay,
just come downstairs.</i>

221
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,364
I'm getting fired.
I can't leave until I've...

222
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,601
Ma'am.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,648
Check the stairway.
Elliot? Elli...

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,001
I'm going to get him.

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,163
All I know is,
it's been six fucking weeks,

226
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,924
and I haven't had
a weekend with my son.

227
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,007
I did trade the car.

228
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,204
I'm taking the subway.
So what?

229
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,605
I'm picking him up
from school today.

230
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,085
<i>They cut
my access privileges.</i>

231
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,446
I completely disagree.
I think

232
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,284
he definitely loves me.
Sir... Sir...

233
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,970
Are you gonna really
get into that right now'?

234
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,808
That was one time
I told him I hated him.

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,889
<i>I'm going
to attract attention.</i>

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,611
<i>I have to remain calm.</i>

237
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,361
<i>Take deep breaths.</i>

238
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,647
Be cool.

239
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,085
<i>Don't panic.

240
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,521
<i>Slow everything way down.</i>

241
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,401
<i>Blend in.</i>

242
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,527
<i>Look bored, broken.</i>

243
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,368
<i>Get a blank office stare
on my face.</i>

244
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,210
<i>This is how they do it,
isn't it?</i>

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,171
<i>How they're able to watch the
world fall apart around them?</i>

246
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,410
<i>Because to them,
this is normal.</i>

247
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,686
<i>It's all they know.</i>

248
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,325
<i>Maybe I can learn from them.</i>

249
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,281
<i>I wish I could see myself
through your eyes.</i>

250
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,042
<i>Don't you wish you could
see yourself through mine?</i>

251
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,888
<i>As we step through our code,
line by line,</i>

252
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,611
<i>debugging it to find the cause
of our runtime error.</i>

253
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,091
<i>What am I doing? I'm still
attracting attention.</i>

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,124
<i>I'll still get caught, and it'll
be painfully slow to watch.</i>

255
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,531
<i>This isn't gonna work.</i>

256
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,050
<i>We need to find an open space,
a network jack.</i>

257
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,645
<i>God damn it, it's the start
of the work week.</i>

258
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,651
<i>Monday morning attendance,</i>

259
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,285
<i>All of the conference rooms
are booked,</i>

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,805
<i>and all of the cubicles
are full.</i>

261
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,087
<i>I'll have to gel someone
off their work station.</i>

262
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,761
<i>Here...</i>

263
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,571
<i>She's the perfect candidate.</i>

264
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,006
Hi, Edie,
I'm Henry from I.T.

265
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,567
Hello.
We've detected you using

266
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,847
some unauthorized
remote access software

267
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,571
to connect to your computer
work station from home.

268
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,927
Oh, my.
That can't be true.

269
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,971
Don't worry, I'm just gonna
take a look at your machine

270
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,168
and perform an assessment
to make sure you don't have

271
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,760
an unauthorized desktop
sharing service installed.

272
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,524
Well, I'm gonna have
to contest that.

273
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,208
I've hardened my install further
than the standard configuration,

274
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,603
including a restrictive
host base firewall rule set,

275
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,969
and white listing to block
unauthorized apps from running.

276
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,730
<i>I might've chosen
the wrong candidate.</i>

277
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,450
I think I know
your culprit, though.

278
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,407
Fred over there
uses GoToMyPC all the time.

279
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,046
Let me introduce you.

280
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,007
Fred...

281
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,571
You loused it up again.

282
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,406
Hi, Fred.

283
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,881
Henry from I.T.
Are you serious?

284
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,371
You gotta take a look
at my machine now?

285
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,521
I just got in.

286
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,170
Listen, I just need it
for 15 minutes.

287
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,526
I'm backlogged here, man.

288
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,807
I got my supervisors
giving me deadlines.

289
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,803
This isn't a matter
of debate.

290
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,647
Whatever. I'll be
in the break room.

291
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,726
<i>Log data from the Dark
Army's back-doored machine.</i>

292
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,007
<i>They're using this guy's account.
Frank Bowman.</i>

293
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,561
<i>He's a member of the code
signing architecture team.</i>

294
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,041
<i>This is what they're doing.</i>

295
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,846
<i>They wanna sign their own
firmware and bypass my patch.</i>

296
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,811
<i>If they do that, they'll blow up
the downtown recovery building.</i>

297
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
<i>My only chance to stop it</i>

298
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,523
<i>is to get to the hardware
security modules, the HSMs.</i>

299
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,126
<i>They're on the 23rd floor.</i>

300
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,881
No, I haven't
seen him.

301
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,925
Did he just come in?

302
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,889
Hi. How are you?

303
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,883
One sec' I'm just
finishing up an email.

304
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,922
I think that you're in the wrong...
Almost finished.

305
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,521
All right.

306
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,764
Excuse me,
very important memo.

307
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,686
We should get started.

308
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,764
I think you're in the wrong room.
I'm sorry, you are?

309
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,444
Sean, head of Sales.
Sean. Of course.

310
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,443
Dave Kennedy. I worked
with Craig on the Q4 push.

311
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,805
I had longer hair then.

312
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,286
Listen, we're on a deadline.
We don't have time for this.

313
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,760
You are in the wrong room.

314
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,442
ELLIOT; Well, maybe there's been some
confusion, either on your end or mine.

315
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,931
What room did you say
this was?

316
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,162
44,120.
44,120..

317
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,889
You know, I think
that's my room.

318
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,007
SEAN; No.

319
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,611
All right, let me check
my calendar.

320
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,328
Service has been spotty
all morning.

321
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,327
All right, here it is.

322
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,321
Ah, you're right,
so embarrassing.

323
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,487
I'm not supposed
to be on 44, 12C.

324
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,565
Yeah, I'm down one floor,
43, 12C.

325
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,440
I should've known. We always
have chocolate donuts too.

326
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,444
Oh, Jesus Christ, you have wasted
enough of our time already.

327
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,681
We need to get started.

328
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,801
You know, Sean,

329
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,600
sometimes I get
a lot like you,

330
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,610
where you have
a lot of anxiety,

331
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,086
because of a deadline,

332
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,647
you know, where you feel
pressure, because...

333
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,450
Something has to get done.

334
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,521
And then,
all of these damn little

335
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,688
unknown variables
keep popping up.

336
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,170
And when you find yourself

337
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,722
at the center
of one of those storms,

338
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,444
man, you just gotta breathe.

339
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,686
Just let go.

340
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,561
Get it done.

341
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,081
Mr. Alderson!

342
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,924
Mr. Alderson!

343
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,004
Hey, stop!

344
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,447
Mr. Alderson, stop!

345
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,929
<i>Shit,
I'm going through the lobby.</i>

346
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,770
<i>Security will force me out.</i>

347
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,723
<i>What should I do?
What would you do?</i>

348
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,725
<i>That's right,
you never answer me.</i>

349
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,683
<i>Is this why I created
Mr. Robot?</i>

350
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,762
<i>To help me get out
of situations like this?</i>

351
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,370
<i>At least he interacts with me.</i>

352
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,283
<i>If Mr. Robot was here,
what would he do?</i>

353
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,046
First thing he'd tell you is to stop
talking to your imaginary friend.

354
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,451
You're not really him, though.

355
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,285
Would you stop trying to
be so technical about everything?

356
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,041
You know if he were here, he'd
tell you exactly what he told you

357
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,451
when he said
to walk away from Vera.

358
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,807
This is a zero-sum game.
Accept the truth.

359
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,405
That building is going
to blow up,

360
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,369
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop it.

361
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,488
I'll find a way to destroy
the HSMs.

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,650
Once I do that, there'll be no way
for the Dark Army to run Stage 2.

363
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,721
How are you gonna do that'?

364
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,165
You're about to be
kicked out, Einstein.

365
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,881
So the real question is, can you
get to the HSMs before they do?

366
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,928
All I need to do is get
to the ground floor.

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,809
Once I'm there, I'll find
a way to get back in.

368
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
With the security they have?

369
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,961
I'll tailgate someone.

370
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,724
Hate to see it, kiddo,
but you'd have better luck

371
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,007
tailgating the parking lot
at a Yo-Yo Ma concert.

372
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,844
They got all their peepers
peeled for you.

373
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,526
I know my way around. Even
if you do get up there,

374
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,206
you got Bobbi and her Keystone
Cops looking for you.

375
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,447
You'll never get away
with that.

376
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,760
And while you're busy
spinning your wheels,

377
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,723
trying to prove
that piece of wisdom wrong,

378
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,250
the recovery building's
going to explode,

379
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,368
and the people inside
right along with it.

380
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,085
<i>He's right.
I need to worry about</i>

381
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,845
<i>the people in the building,
not the HSMs.</i>

382
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
<i>But there is no he.</i>

383
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,084
<i>That was just my imagination.</i>

384
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,163
<i>We haven't seen
each other in months.</i>

385
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,482
<i>We've been battling each other
in our own voids.</i>

386
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,128
<i>But at feast now
I know my next move.</i>

387
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,562
This is what
democracy looks like!

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,651
Elliot Alderson, we've been instructed
to escort you off the premises.

389
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,049
Show me what
democracy looks like!

390
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,009
This is what
democracy looks like!

391
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,684
Show me what
democracy looks like!

392
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,370
This is what
democracy looks like!

393
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,090
Show me what
democracy looks like!

394
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,083
This is what
democracy looks like!

395
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,804
Show me what
democracy looks like!

396
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,928
This is what
democracy looks like!

397
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,729
Show me what
democracy looks like!

398

<i>E</i> Corp Recovery Center.

399
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,563
<i>How may I direct your call?
Listen, there's gonna be</i>

400
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,563
a buildup of hydrogen
in your data center.

401
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,768
<i>Sir, I'm having trouble hearing you.
Would you like me to connect you...</i>

402
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,808
You've gotta get everyone
out of the building now.

403
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,884
A spark will ignite the hydrogen
and bring the whole place down.

404
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,970
Have someone look at the battery
room for your UPS devices.

405
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,041
Sir, UPS?

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,731
<i>We use E Shipping
for our freight services here.</i>

407
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,485
<i>Would you like me to transfer
you to the warehouse?</i>

408
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,723
There's a fucking bomb in your building.
Clear everyone out now.

409
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,407
<i>Hopefully that gives
everyone enough time to get out.</i>

410
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,205
<i>Now all I need to do
is find a way to...</i>

411
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,281
Elliot!

412
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,525
You've gotta help me
get back inside.

413
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,321
I have to tell you something.

414
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,243
There's a code
signing machine on 23.

415
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,249
We have to find a way to...
I'm working with the FBI.

416
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,847
After Cisco,
when the FBI questioned me,

417
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,126
they did more than that.

418
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,009
They had everything
laid out on this board.

419
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,283
Us, Angela,
Trenton, Mobley, everyone.

420
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,726
They had been following
our every move for months.

421
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,847
They knew everything.

422
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,161
And Tyrell, they think
he's at the center of it all.

423
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,287
Wait a minute.

424
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,967
Back up.

425
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,724
This has been going on
since Cisco?

426
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,205
You've been working
with them? The FBI?

427
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,286
Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,610
I made a deal for us.

429
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,929
All they want is Tyrell.
What?

430
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,801
What deal?

431
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,646
Is that why you hacked me?

432
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,201
For them?

433
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,721
What's going on?

434
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,209
Are you wearing
a fucking wire right now'?

435
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,481
No.

436
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,328
No, they don't even know
that I'm here.

437
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,208
Elliot, I'm telling you
the truth.

438
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,841
ELLIOT; The truth?

439
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,801
The truth?

440
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,481
You've been working
with the FBI behind my back'?

441
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,240
You've been spying on me?

442
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,560
<i>Am I to blame for this?</i>

443
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,087
<i>Not telling her how much
I miss Mr. Robot?</i>

444
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,242
<i>How a pan of me may have
let all of this happen?</i>

445
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,330
The other night, I followed
you like you asked me to.

446
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,727
He snuck out of the apartment
around 2:00 a.m.,

447
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,565
and met up with Angela.

448
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,850
She knew it was him.

449
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,289
I think the two of them
have been working with...

450
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,361
Tyrell.

451
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,961
ELLIOT; That's if.

452
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,370
<i>My runtime error.

453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,361
I saw her...

454
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,521
And him.

455
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,963
I was standing in a room
and they were together.

456
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,441
<i>Angela is the one behind this.
I gotta stop her.</i>

457
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,050
Angela's been
betraying you'?

458
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,041
So have you.

459
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,725
You kept this from me.

460
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,451
You've been trying to play me
this whole fucking time?

461
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,325
This is what
democracy looks like!

462
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,129
Show me what

470
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,444
Four, three, two, one...

471
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,567
We are live.

472
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,089
Okay, we've live
in five, four, three...

473
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,242
Thanks, Jack. I'm here
outside E Corp headquarters,

474
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,011
and while it's typical
to see daily protesters,

475
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,560
it's unusual for the crowd
to be this size

476
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,801
and this vocal.

477
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,206
An NYPD official told me

478
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,527
they're taking the situation
very seriously,

479
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,081
and sending in additional
units for crowd control.

480
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,721
What's less clear
is why today.

481
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,804
With an all-time high
unemployment rate of 26%,

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,321
giving many citizens
something to march about,

483
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,050
most of the protesters
I spoke with

484
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,090
did give me varying answers
as to why they're here.

485
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,889
From forced currency changes

486
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,769
to corporate greed
and corruption,

487
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,451
I even had one
gentleman tell me

488
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,921
he was here to protest
this morning's U.N. vote,

489
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,289
that he felt it was somehow
connected to E Corp.

490
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,283

501
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,847
Calm down!

502
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,083
This is what
democracy looks like!

503
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
Everybody!

504
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,606
This is what

505
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,371
Settle down!
Everyone!

506
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,487

508
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,287
Everyone!

509
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,001
Scan your badge.

510
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,849
I said
scan your badge now!

511
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>Tensions are running high,</i>

512

vote approaches.</i>

513

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,725

539

Elliot?

540
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,450
What contingency plan?

541
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,851
<i>He needs to get

545
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,001

546
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,650
<i>Good.
Take the package to Elliot.</i>

547

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,406
Ma'am,
what are you doing here'?

558
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,649
Ifs not safe for you
to be on elevators.

559
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,721
I was, urn...

560
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,487
I'm trying to get
to my office on 23.

561
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,006
There's a secure room
and a safe zone on 23

562
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,650
with no windows.
I'll take you there.

563
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,648
<i>Okay. Thank you. WOMAN ON TV: As no
permanent members of the council</i>

This is Murphy.
I'm on elevator four.

569
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,206
We just lost power. I'm stuck
between floors 26 and 25.

570
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,081
Don't worry,
they'll sort it out.

571
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,527
We'll be fine.
What's in the package?

572
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,285
Hopefully it's something we can eat.
We may be here a while.

573
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,801
Hard drives.

574
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,964
Probably not
the healthiest choice.

575
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,000
Here,
let me help you with that.

576
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,570
Oh, no, it's okay.

577
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,124
What the heck is this?

578
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,050
It belongs
to my direct report.

579
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,645
He ran out of a meeting

580
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,728
and left his badge
in a conference room.

581
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,926
I'm bringing it back to him.

582
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,890
Interesting
that your direct report

583
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,689
has special access
and you don't.

584
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,806
You're gonna have
to come with me.

619
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,326
Hey.

620
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,887
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

621
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,601
Sorry.

622
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,841
Have you seen what they're
doing out there? It's insane.

623
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,807
Yeah, I know.

624
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,606
YOU Okay?

625
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,650
Yeah, lam now.

626
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,721
Wait...

627
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,406
How did you get in here?

628
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,690
I'm a part of the internal
audit team, out of Detroit.

629
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,044
Was in the middle of an unannounced
physical security audit

630
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,050
of the code signing operation.

631
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,688
Ah, you fucking bitch!

632
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,761
<i>Attention,

642
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,368
<i>This great country didn't
start out with 50 states,</i>

643
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,771
<i>so why stop at 50 states?</i>

644
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,764
<i>And, fer me add,
that this is why we need</i> a <i>man</i>

645
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,047
<i>with a business acumen like
Donald Trump as President.</i>

646
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,488
<i>If China makes another move
like they did today,</i>

647
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,451
<i>our standing as a world superpower
will be put into question.</i>

648
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,126
<i>Mr. Trump has the drive,
the ambition to help us...</i>

649
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,685
<i>Marlinspike.
Moxie.</i>

650
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,970
It's done,
but we got a problem.

651
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,606
I was made.

652
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,206
There was a woman
in the CSAT room. She saw me.

653
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,521
<i>Wait, why were you in
that room instead of Elliot?</i>

654
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,481
I couldn't find him.

655
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,451
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

656
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,488
Your distraction
is fucking overkill.

657
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,247
I couldn't find him in the
middle of a goddamn riot.

658
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,446
Your men came after me.

659
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,885
<i>Well, they're not all ours.</i>

660
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,803
<i>Just 'cause we lit the fuse doesn't
mean we control the explosion.</i>

661
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,202
<i>You weren't supposed to be
on that ﬂoor anyway.</i>

662
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,926
You said you wanted it done
immediately, so I got it done.

663
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,041
Uh-huh.

664
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,765
<i>This woman who saw you,</i>

665
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,686
<i>did you get her name?</i>

666
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,807
Lydia Riley.

667
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,806
<i>We'll take care of it.</i>

668
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,128
<i>So, you were able
to follow everything</i>

669
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,645
<i>on that sheet of paper, huh?</i>

670
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,207
<i>Angela, if you didn't do
everything on that list...</i>

671
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,725
Yes, yeah, I got it done.

672
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
Oh, good.

673
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,764
<i>There's a delivery man waiting for
you at Reception on your floor.</i>

674
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,684
<i>Give him the package
with everything in it.</i>

675
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,241
Irving?

676
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,928
Are you still gonna evacuate
the Recovery Center?

677
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,841
<i>That's been done already.</i>

678
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,171
So this is really happening'?

679
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,765
<i>We need you
to stay strong.</i>

680
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,923
<i>It's like you said, she can
make all of this better.</i>

681
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,091
<i>This is a step toward that.</i>

682
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,486
