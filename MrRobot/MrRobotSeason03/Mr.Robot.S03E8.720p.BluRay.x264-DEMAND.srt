1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,849
<i>Seventy one buildings
exploded or caught fire.</i>

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,604
Elliot, tell me what
it is that you think he did.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,523
Sorry. I don't know
if I can say.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,129
No matter what happens now,
everything will be fine.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,004
<i>I should be at home
with my family.</i>

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,969
<i>My brother is probably
flipping out right now.</i>

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,087
I'll be back later.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,367
<i>What do normal people
do when they get this sad?</i>

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,283
<i>I</i> do morphine.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,687
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means'?

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,808
We can potentially
undo this whole thing.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,003
Everything in this room
is only here to tell a story.

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,320
If anything
does happen to us...

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,649
<i>If I don't make it
back to my computer,</i>

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,529
I sent the email to go out
automatically.

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,046
No, don't do this!
Stop!

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,281
To someone I trust.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,531
Your dad pushed you
out a window?

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,284
Broke my arm.
Went to the hospital.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,640
<i>I</i> was angry.

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,926
<i>I hated myself.</i>

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
It's okay. I'll get it
out of my system

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,246
before the movie.
Don't you worry.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,445
Here.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,324
All right.
Dump them on in there.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,687
Come on.
You know what to do.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,766
Come on, kiddo.
Shake 'em up.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,449
What? You don't want any?

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,405
Told you I didn't wanna come.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,647
I know, but...

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,445
It's movie night.
Is it the movie?

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,284
I thought you wanted to see
Shallow Grave.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,200
I hear it's pretty good.

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,881
Um...

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,524
Maybe we could see this,
Jerky Boys thing.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,886
Maybe it's not sold out yet.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,447
I wanna go home.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,886
How long are you
gonna be mad at me?

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,562
I told you I was sorry.
You're not sorry.

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,449
You're just sick and
don't want to admit it.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,401
You're right.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
I made some mistakes.

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,969
I wish I could have been
a better father to you.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,409
All I'm asking is
that you'll forgive me.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,805
Do you think you'll ever
be able to do that?

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,761
No.

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,921
Yeah.

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,446
Maybe we should leave.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,442
Oh' my!
Somebody call 911!

50
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,488
The movie's about to start.

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,082
<i>Welcome. Your
movie will begin shortly.</i>

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,562
<i>Please keep our theaters clean</i>

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,480
<i>by disposing of your trash in
the specified waste containers.</i>

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,850
<i>Food and refreshments
are available in the lobby.</i>

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,607
<i>Gift certificates
are also available</i>

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,409
<i>on special occasions.</i>

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,004
<i>Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.</i>

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,121
<i>When you delete something,</i>

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,964
<i>you're making a choice
to destroy it.</i>

60
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
<i>To never see it again.</i>

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,450
<i>You choose to delete because
you need to free up space.</i>

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,649
<i>Because you don't
want it anymore.</i>

63
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,763
<i>Because it no longer
holds value.</i>

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,409
<i>Is that what happened
to Mobley and Trenton?</i>

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,964
<i>Were they unwanted?
Taking up too much space?</i>

66
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,370
You can't keep doing this. What?

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,926
Why did you wipe-down?

68
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,887
Routine.

69
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,970
You need to talk to Angela.

70
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,362
She is not doing well.
Last time I saw her,

71
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,329
she was going through
a full-on breakdown.

72
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,401
I don't care.

73
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,210
She should be
breaking down.

74
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,561
Nice.

75
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,971
I recall her
being there for you

76
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,605
when you had
your little episode.

77
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,481
Multiple times.
Guess I'm an asshole.

78
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,291
It's been three weeks.

79
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,969
You haven't left
your apartment.

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,846
I'm getting worried
about you.

81
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,684
Don't.
What happened

82
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,888
with the attacks,
that's not you.

83
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,401
Even if it was him,
it was me.

84
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,524
How do you even know
he did this?

85
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,443
What does it even matter,
Darlene?

86
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,921
He got what he wanted.
Didn't he?

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,962
Except, wait a minute. Nope.

88
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,011
E Corp's still gonna be
just fine because of Ecoin.

89
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,682
He sure didn't see
that coming, did he?

90
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,770
Whoops! Oh, well.

91
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,202
Consolation prize,
at least we get to be

92
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,487
miraculously off the hook
for everything.

93
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,849
Yes, sure, a couple of good people
had to die in disgrace for that.

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,207
But who's counting
at this point? Am I right'?

95
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,162
I mean, I'm sure he's just
doing fucking dandy.

96
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,970
If that's what this is about,
you can still get rid of him.

97
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,408
You don't get it.
I tried everything.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,482
The medication, therapy...

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,049
Fuck, I even put
myself in jail.

100
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,881
He won't leave.

101
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,649
He won't leave
because I wanted this.

102
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,164
I liked ii.

103
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,370
Fuck you.

104
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,367
You're really scaring the
shit out of me right now.

105
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,764
I'm not trying
to scare you.

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,126
I just...

107
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,202
Just give me some time.

108
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,601
I need to find my own way
to cope with this.

109
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,211
I don't believe you.

110
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
I feel like...

111
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,051
I feel like
you're giving up.

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,691
Just let me
stay with you.

113
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,321
Okay, that'll make me
feel better. Please.

114
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,365
I just wanna be alone.

115
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,764
Give me some time. Okay?

116
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,761
I tell you what.

117
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,043
You come by tomorrow,
we'll smoke up,

118
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,248
<i>and we can watch
Careful Massacre.</i>

119
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,564
It's not even Halloween.

120
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,401
Since when did we start
following the rules?

121
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,887
I'd like that.

122
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,601
Me too.

123
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,128
Just for the day. You'd
be doing me a big favor.

124
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,567
Of course.
She's practically family.

125
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,322
I'll bring her toys and food over.

126
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,006
She likes this purple
eggplant thing.

127
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,045
I know. You, left it here
the last time.

128
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,681
And I got food left over,
so we're good for the day.

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,286
<i>Deletion.
When you make that decision,</i>

130
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,326
<i>there's always that
moment of hesitation.</i>

131
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,691
<i>That annoying, "Are you
sure?" dialog box.</i>

132
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,530
<i>And then you
have to make a call.</i>

133
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,401
<i>Yes or no.</i>

134
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,649
<i>Yes means ridding myself and the
world of Mr. Robot forever.</i>

135
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,291
<i>That includes you.</i>

136
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,800
There you go.
Thanks.

137
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,167
Next?

138
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,171
<i>Maybe it's something I
should have done a long time ago.</i>

139
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,127
Thanks.

140
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,761
Next.

141
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,210
This is Hard Andy's
pure grade,

142
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,567
top shelf,
all-name-brand supply.

143
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,563
No knock-offs or generics.

144
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,570
This is all straight from
the pharma's assembly line.

145
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,571
You got Addys, Exies,
Black Beauties, Oxies,

146
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,768
Xannies, Roxis...
Morphine.

147
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,447
Miss Emma.

148
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,527
She's good.

149
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,681
Those come straight from the manufacturing
plant in Jersey. Like I said,

150
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,081
Hard Andy's supply
is always clean.

151
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,285
Pure as a nun's cunt.

152
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,925
I'll take it.
Perfect.

153
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,847
Let me get you a bottle.
The whole bag.

154
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,645
That's my whole stash.

155
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,603
Then you just made
an easy sale.

156
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,206
Refresh my memory.

157
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,970
How do we know
each other, again?

158
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,404
Referral. We got
a friend in common.

159
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,567
Take off your shirt.
Come on, man.

160
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,051
You just did
a pat-down outside.

161
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,122
I said take off
your fucking shirt.

162
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,929
See, people don't
usually come in here

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,321
trying to buy
Hard Andy's whole stash

164
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,368
unless one of three
prerequisites are met.

165
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,922
One, they got their nose
up some fuzz's ass

166
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,480
which we will soon ascertain.
Pants, also.

167
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,805
Two, you're trying
to resell in my market.

168
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,647
But... you don't strike me
as a dummy with a death wish.

169
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,721
Spin around.

170
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,045
Which leaves three.

171
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,363
Life that unbearable, baby'?

172
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,564
Cute little boy like you.

173
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,729
The pleasure
I could give you.

174
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,407
Such a shame.

175
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,691
Maybe you do have
that death wish after all.

176
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,481
What do you want?

177
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,560
I was a friend
of your brother, Mobley.

178
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,490
I mean, Sunil.
Get lost, man.

179
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,561
Wait.

180
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,889
I just wanted to pay
my respects.

181
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,611
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I should go.

182
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,527
That fat fuck doesn't deserve
respect from anyone.

183
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,169
Do you know how much
he's damaged my career?

184
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,922
My firm is on the verge
of firing me.

185
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,923
I get that you're going
through a lot.

186
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,841
But don't believe the lies
you read about him.

187
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,888
They're not true.
It's been all over the news.

188
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,967
What, do you think they just
make this shit up now?

189
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,441
The facts are there.

190
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,282
He was working
with the Iranians.

191
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,891
And I have no doubt he got lured
into some bullshit like that.

192
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,564
He's been a fuck-up
his whole life.

193
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,091
I just want to know where
I can go to say a few words.

194
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,525
Your guess is
<i>as</i> good as mine.

195
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,806
There's no way I was gonna pay
for a terrorist's funeral.

196
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,524
<i>This is a reminder

204
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,167
Are you moving?

205
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,006
Are you leaving the city?

206
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,969
Please, sir.
We don't want any trouble.

207
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,724
I'm not here to give you
any trouble.

208
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,526
I just wanted to talk.

209
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,329
Please, we just want
to leave in peace.

210
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,730
I went to school
with your daughter.

211
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,048
I wanted to say
she was a good person.

212
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,401
What do you want from us?

213
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,730
I want you to know
she's innocent.

214
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,928
I'm sorry, how did you know
my daughter, again?

215
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,124
Did you speak with her
before she left?

216
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,043
Do you know why she went
to Arizona?

217
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,727
No.

218
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,681
I just know her.

219
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,409
I know she
wouldn't do this.

220
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,929
Shama was a victim.
Somebody did this to her.

221
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,601
This country now blames
Muslims for everything.

222
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,569
There's no room
for us here anymore.

223
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,922
Thank you for saying nice
things about my daughter.

224
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,206
MOHAMMED;
That's a lot of pills.

225
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,481
Are you sick?

226
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,607
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here'?

227
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,969
Where are your parents?
Who cares?

228
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,451
I don't need
a babysitter.

229
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,921
Go home.

230
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,561
Leave me alone.

231
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,925
I don't know
how to go home.

232
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,322
What do you mean? Just go
back the way you came.

233
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,166
Where did I come from?
Go down the street.

234
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,241
Take the train.

235
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,081
I don't know
how to do that.

236
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,840
Well, how did
you get here'?

237
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,041
I followed you.

238
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,931
What are you doing?
Sitting here.

239
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,760
You don't own the beach.

240
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,490
Are you serious, man?

241
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,964
Your parents are probably
really worried about you.

242
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,281
Hold you. I don't
need a babysitter.

243
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,485
Besides,
I don't wanna go home.

244
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,961
Why do you think my sister
didn't do anything wrong?

245
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,962
Dude, you can't
just stay here.

246
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,126
Come on.

247
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,321
Come with me.

248
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,050
You sure
this is a shortcut?

249
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
It's the
way we always go.

250
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,731
My sister used to take me
this way after prayer.

251
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,040
Our mosque
is on the way.

252
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,521
Where do you pray?

253
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,567
I don't.

254
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,563
You're lucky.
It's so boring,

255
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,688
and your face is always
up another guy's butt.

256
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,488
At the mosque,
Shanna used to trip

257
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,210
whenever she put
her shoes back on.

258
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,161
I can do it while standing
and not fall down.

259
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,406
You wanna see?
No.

260
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,049
That's awesome.
Can you do it'?

261
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,121
Probably.

262
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,569
You sure this is the fastest
way to your home?

263
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,051
I gotta get back
to Coney Island.

264
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,561
<i>Why'?</i>

265
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,246
Because I have
something to do.

266
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,126
What?
It's personal.

267
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,487
Like what?

268
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,885
Let's talk about
something else.

269
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,521
Like what?

270
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,610
Don't worry about it.
Why?

271
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,606
This is a reminder.

272
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,127
<i>Today's citywide curfew begins at 9:00 p.m.

274
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,047
Where are your parents?

275
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,607
They usually leave me home
alone when they go out.

276
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,885
The door locks
automatically.

277
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,887
Do you have a phone?
I wish.

278
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,081
Do you know their number?

279
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,127
Their phone number.
I don't know.

280

282
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,042

No.

283
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,531
Do you like horses?
No.

284
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,886
Do you like Wii U?
No.

285
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,007
Do you like movies?

286
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,441
I used to.

287
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,250
I've never been
to the movies.

288
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,004
My parents say
it's too expensive.

289
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,161
That sucks.

290
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,482
Would you take me?
Take you where?

291
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,043
To the movies. Duh.

292
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,327
No. Can't take you
to the movies.

293
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,970
I told you I have
something I gotta do.

294
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,603
Besides, there's probably
nothing good playing.

295
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,804
If your parents come home
and see that you're missing,

296
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,451
they'll probably
call the cops.

297
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,607
How far away did they go?
Are they close?

298
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,245
Dan bury.
In Connecticut?

299
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,131
That's two hours away.

300
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,083
My uncle lives there.
He likes to live by the mall.

301
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,442
He's bald.
This is serious.

302
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,888
I can't sit here
for two hours.

303
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,686
That's what I'm telling you.
We should go to the movies.

304
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,047
Are you lying to me just
so I take you to the movies?

305
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,527
No.

306
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,203
We're only going if
something good is playing.

307
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,730
<i>What's Back to the Future?</i>

308
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,850
<i>Can we see
The Martian instead?</i>

309
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,487
Are you kidding?

310
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,488
First of all, The Martian
looks like shit.

311
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,400
Second of all, you've never
seen Back to the Future?

312
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,888
No. It looks like an old movie.

313
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,760
You don't understand.

314
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,490
Today's the day that Marty
travels into the future.

315
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,642
I've wanted to see
this movie on this day

316
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
since I was your age.

317
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,248
So weird that it's today.
Why?

318
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,967
It won't make sense to you. Why?

319
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,162
What are you doing?
You just ruined it.

320
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,561
This is the best way
to eat popcorn.

321
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,521
Trust me.

322
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,760
Wow. That's good.

323
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,611
No shit. Come on.

324
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,969
So, what is this film
about, anyway?

325
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,960
It's hard to explain.

326
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,924
Ifs about going
into the future

327
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,411
to change the past,

328
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,485
then coming back into an
alternate present day.

329
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,723
No, you can't go into the
future to change the past.

330
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,446
Ifs way heavier
than that.

331
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,842
He goes into the future
to change the future.

332
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,690
But that allows Biff
to change the past,

333
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,125
which changes
the future again.

334
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,884
No, no, it's much
simpler than that.

335
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,122
It's about how one mistake
can change the world.

336
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,886
Now seating for
Back to the Future Part ll.

337
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,764
Are you sure we can't
see The Martian?

338
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,290
Come on.
You're gonna love it.

339
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,571
But The Martian has 92%
on Rotten Tomatoes.

340
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,331
That's because most critics
have shitty taste.

341
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,166
<i>Excuse
the disguise, Marty,</i>

342
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,924
<i>but I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.</i>

343
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,766
Would you mind holding my
Flux Capacitor for a second?

344
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,241
I... I gotta clean
my glasses.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,166
<i>Changed the blood, added a
good 30 to 40 years to my life.</i>

346
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,010
<i>They also replaced
my spleen and colon.</i>

347
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,646
<i>What do you think?</i>

348
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,486
<i>You look great, Doc.</i>

349
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,481
<i>The future. Unbelievable.</i>

350
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,410
<i>I gotta check this out, Doc.</i>

351
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,642
<i>Ah' in good time, Marty.
Were on</i> a <i>tight schedule here.</i>

352
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,007
<i>Tell me about my future.
I mean, I know I make it big,</i>

353
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,889
<i>but what do I become, like,
a rich rock star?</i>

354
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,291
<i>Please, Marty.
No one should know too much</i>

355
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,124
<i>about their own destiny.
Right, right-</i>

356
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,887
<i>I am rich, though, right?</i>

357
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,405
<i>Marty, please.
Take off your shirt.</i>

358
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,211
<i>Put on the jacket
and shoes.</i>

359
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,570
<i>We've got a mission
to accomplish!</i>

360
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,891
Hey, come on, dude.

361
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,405
Have you seen a little boy
like this tall?

362
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,490
Blue hoodie?
Yeah.

363
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,647
He peaced out.

364
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,211
These heels
are the pits.

365
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,651
I should have gone
as 1955 Lorraine.

366
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,721
Ow.

367
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,044
What? Try me.

368
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,367
I'm looking for a mosque.
It's near a playground.

369
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,810
Masjid Al Rahman
or The Islamic Society?

370
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,524
Come on, we'll figure it out.

371
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,921
I have good friends
in both places. Come on.

372
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,291
What are you waiting for?
Get in.

373
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,441
<i>Ladies</i> and gentlemen,

374
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,760
<i>I have a grave announcement
to make.</i>

375
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,445
<i>Incredible as it may seem,</i>

376
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,727
<i>both the observations
of science and the evidence</i>

377
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,280
<i>of our eyes lead
to the inescapable assumption</i>

378
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,601
<i>that those strange beings
who landed in the Jersey</i>

379
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,728
<i>farmlands tonight
are the vanguard</i>

380
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,643
<i>of an invading army
from the planet Mars.</i>

381
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,846
<i>War of the Worlds, huh?</i>

382
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,927
Why not?

383
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,885
'Cause it's about the end
of the world.

384
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,325
No, that's incorrect.

385
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,207
Things get a little fakakta
for a while,

386
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,081
but at the end,
humans actually persevere.

387
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,288
<i>Monstrous creatures
in the world now seems</i>

388
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,691
<i>part of another life.</i>

389
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,891
<i>A life that has no continuity
with the present.</i>

390
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,364
Why did you bail on me
at the theater?

391
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,488
I would have come here with
you, if that's what you wanted.

392
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,207
No, you wouldn't.

393
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,328
You keep saying you have
something you have to do.

394
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,090
I do have something to do.

395
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,371
Now come on.
We're going back.

396
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,331
Why did you come
to our house?

397
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,164
Yo, this isn't cool, okay?
I gotta go.

398
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,571
Is it that important?

399
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,491
Yes.
Why'?

400
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,648
It's none of your business.
You're a baby.

401
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,245
You're annoying.
You are!

402
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,289
This is a nightmare.
You are!

403
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,725
So are you!
I wish you were dead!

404
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,887
So do I!

405
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,249
Sometimes I feel like I...

406
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,961
Did something bad
that made Shama leave.

407
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,044
You didn't do
anything wrong.

408
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,850
All right.
I'm gonna give you five.

409
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,803
And then we're gonna go.
I'm not going anywhere.

410
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,967
Just leave me alone.

411
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,290
It wasn't your fault.

412
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,606
Or hers.

413
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,128
It was mine.
All of it.

414
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,168
So don't blame her
or yourself.

415
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,247
You can blame me.

416
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,926
You know, you talk about
yourself a lot.

417
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,768
And you're not allowed
to wear shoes here.

418
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,082
I'm not gonna trip
when I put them back on.

419
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,281
We'll see.

420
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,210
Did you know I could be
President of the United States?

421
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,123
Yeah?
My sister couldn't be.

422
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,726
She wasn't born here.

423
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,850
My mom and dad
couldn't, either.

424
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,283
I'm the only person in my
family who could be President.

425
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,601
Isn't that cool?

426
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,360
If I were President...

427
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,090
I would be able
to stay here.

428
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,365
In the house we live in.

429
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,121
I would find a way
to bring back my sister.

430
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,122
I'd put the real
bad guys in jail.

431
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,322
And... And I'd make everyone
eat Pop Tarts for dinner.

432
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,129
And then make everyone
be nice to me.

433
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,645
So you'd be a dictator.

434
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,281
What's a dictator?

435
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,928
Ifs like a really
bad President.

436
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,407
Can you be President?
Probably not.

437
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,762
So you're like my sister?
You weren't born here?

438
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,166
<i>No, I was.</i>

439
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,121
Where?
New Jersey.

440
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,801
Really? Me too.

441
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,691
What part?
Washington Township.

442
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,843
Where were you born?
Trenton.

443
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,123
Looks like your parents
still aren't home.

444
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,690
You had the keys
this whole time?

445
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,285
Thanks for taking me
to the movies.

446
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,287
Wait.

447
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,521
What's your name?

448
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,121
Elliot.

449
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,641
Thanks, Elliot.

450
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,765
Sorry I made you late.

451
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,647
Hope you can still
do your important thing.

452
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,441
Hey, Elliot?

453
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,966
Can I see you again?

454
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,007
Yeah.

455
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,323
Before you go, I'll take
you to see The Martian.

456
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Ifs always better to see
movies on the big screen.

457
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,046
Really?

458
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,243
Yeah.
Thanks, Elliot.

459
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,890
I think you'll like it.
Matt Damon is awesome.

460
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,641
Stay here.

461
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,245
I've got something for you.

462
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,091
Because you said
you were sick.

463
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,167
Bye.

464
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,966
You again. What the fuck
do you want?

465
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,804
You're gonna have a funeral
for your brother.

466
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,121
A proper one.
Okay, dipshit.

467
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,761
We're not having a funeral
for that waste of space.

468
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,569
Your problem is
you never knew him.

469
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,847
If you did, you'd know
he's not capable of that.

470
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,003
Get the fuck off my property
before I call the cops.

471
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,242
I'll go. But before I do,

472
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,807
you should probably change
your corporate email password.

473
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,129
Using your street address, even if
it's an old one, isn't the smartest.

474
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,446
Don't feel special.
I hack everyone.

475
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,962
From the emails I found,
you and your law firm

476
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,482
swapped some shady memos that I don't
think the IRS would look too kindly on.

477
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,651
What do you think
you found?

478
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,285
If you don't want me
sending them out,

479
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,209
make sure your brother
gets a funeral.

480
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,087
A good one.

481
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,161
I want an invite.

482
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,165
I'll make sure
you get my email.

483
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,361
Bullshit.

484
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,045
Got these from Hard Andy.

485
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,647
One of your shady clients
I was talking about.

486
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,570
I won't be needing
them anymore.

487
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,484
The money you make
selling them back to him

488
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,085
will more than pay
for a funeral.

489
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,411
Start writing a eulogy.

490
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,887
A good one.

491
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,168
I'll be in the back
listening.

492
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,801
It's me.

493
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,041
Angela.

494
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,321
Come on. Open up.

495
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,887
Let's talk.

496
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,611
I'm worried about you.

497
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,084
I wish I could say something
that could snap you out of this.

498
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,925
Remember when we used to do
our wishing game?

499
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,129
We'd close our eyes,
and we'd wish for something.

500
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,806
Whatever we wanted.

501
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,802
We both wished we could
get bigger bedrooms.

502
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,566
That was a big one.

503
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,691
You would always wish
for more protractors,

504
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,966
which was weird.

505
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,289
I would wish
for a faster computer.

506
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,125
Probably faster modem too.

507
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,444
You would wish
for better clothes.

508
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,569
I didn't really care
about that.

509
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,847
We both...

510
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,604
we both wished
we could drive.

511
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,690
I just wanted to drive away.

512
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,122
We wanted to go
on road trips.

513
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,490
And eat lots
of Sour Patch Kids

514
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,520
that we would buy
from gas stations.

515
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,249
After we made
all our wishes...

516
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,882
We'd close our eyes
really hard,

517
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,209
hoping that when
we opened them,

518
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,731
it'd all come true.

519
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,802
And we thought the harder
we closed them,

520
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,209
the stronger our wishes
would be.

521
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,731
And even though
they never came true,

522
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,245
we still liked doing it.

523
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,521
Because the ending was never
our favorite part, anyway.

524
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,881
It was the wishing.

525
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,571
I didn't get that at first.

526
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,522
You remember
what you used to say to me

527
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,129
right before we opened
our eyes...

528
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,410
that would make it all better?

529
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,285
No matter what happens,
we'll be okay.

530
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,243
<i>That's the thing
about deletion.</i>

531
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,610
<i>It's not always permanent.</i>

532
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,851
<i>There are many reasons why you wanna
recover a file you just deleted.</i>

533
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,163
<i>When you have that
moment of panic,</i>

534
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,883
<i>where it hits you,
where that thing you thought</i>

535
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,611
<i>had no value suddenly
becomes important.</i>

536
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,286
<i>Where you suddenly find
new purpose for it.</i>

537
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,165
<i>Maybe there are still things
left for me to do.</i>
