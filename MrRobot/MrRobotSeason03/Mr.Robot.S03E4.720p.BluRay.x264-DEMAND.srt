1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,602
You brought me in to manage him,
and that's exactly what I've done.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,170
I'm going to get him
a job at Evil Corp.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,208
Doesn't hurt to have him
on the inside.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,890
<i>I'm sending
shipping requests</i>

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,571
<i>to the actual facilities,
but in the manifest,</i>

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,883
<i>I'm making it look like all the paper
is still arriving in New York.</i>

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,207
How do you bring justice
to a conglomerate

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,203
<i>as</i> untouchable as Evil Corp?

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,806
<i>ANGELA; When I met Whiterose,
she opened my eyes,</i>

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,008
<i>and I could see how
all of the damage</i>

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,686
<i>that they've caused
could finally be undone.</i>

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,886
No!

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,606
Don't you see it yet?

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,091
We are gods.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,207
What's that for?

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,805
In case Elliot comes back.

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,882
<i>He sometimes can become
a different person.</i>

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,961
Answer me!

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,202
Stay away from
me, you fucking psycho.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,890
I like what you did
with the place.

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,291
Still like mine better though.

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>You ever think about
not doing this shit anymore?</i>

23
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,084
Can't we just be a normal couple
that complains about the water bill,

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,801
looks up vacation packages
to Budapest?

25
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,961
<i>Hello, E Corp.</i>

26
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,122
Guys back at CART are
zeroing in on the guy in the video.

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,241
We might have
a good lead soon.

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,563
<i>Your job is to get intel
from Elliot on Tyrell Wellick.</i>

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,722
<i>That is the only reason
you're not in jail right now.</i>

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,802
Good job. You get anything
from Elliot's computer?

31
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,882
Last night he sent an
encrypted e-mail with a link.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,809
DiPIERRO: Is
that coming from downstairs?

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,327
Is Darlene home?

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,087
Hey.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,801
I said "hey."

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,006
<i>What's your deal?</i>

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,370
Come on, dude,
I don't have all day.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,201
What do you want?

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,725
Come on, look around you.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,483
The entire train is either
asleep or drop-dead exhausted.

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,006
Meanwhile, you're over here
riverdancing,

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,923
trying way too hard to pretend
like you're in a hurry

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,684
to get somewhere we both know
you don't have to be.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,244
Honestly, I don't know
what you're saying.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,850
You have my wallet.

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,050
You're batshit.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,243
And you're a terrible
pickpocket.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,526
Take out my wallet.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,121
Take it out, now.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,681
Open it.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,682
There should be a Polaroid
inside. Take it out.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,003
Look, I didn't take anything.
Just take it back.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,286
Take out the Polaroid.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,167
Was that so hard?

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,087
Thank you.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,167
Wait, what is this? Don't you
want your wallet back?

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,441
It's yours.

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,441
<i>Why'?</i>

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,811
You stole from me,
but I stole from you first.

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,130
That old lady knitting,

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,166
that frat dude over there,
I stole from them too.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,401
Everyone.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,291
This whole economic
fuckshow is my fault,

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,682
and everything that's happened
to you and everybody else

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,649
since Five/Nine,
that's my bad too.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,042
That's not even
the cherry on top.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,845
I killed a woman.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,488
Got her right in the heart
with a stun gun.

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,361
This is me.

70
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,241
Wait!

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,166
Metadata.

72
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,523
<i>The story behind the data.</i>

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,721
<i>Getting information
is one thing,</i>

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,642
<i>but how it was created,
where and by whom</i>

75
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,169
<i>can often be illuminating.</i>

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,247
NORM; Who the fuck is that?

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,404
Is Darlene home?
No, she's out.

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,884
This e-mail wasn't for Tyrell.

79
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,121
It was for us.

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,529
Fuck me sideways,
how did he know?

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,967
He must've phished us
when you went to that URL.

82
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,166
Shit, shit, Shit.

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,247
Should we bring him in?
What if Darlene gets back?

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,289
<i>Like most pics people
post on Instagram or Facebook,</i>

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,169
<i>they don't realize
they just gifted</i>

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,846
<i>whatever social media site
their camera type,</i>

87
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,161
<i>phone model, name,
and location,</i>

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,167
<i>all hidden inside
the photograph's metadata.</i>

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,847
Come on, Darlene,
pick up the goddamn phone.

90
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,164
Jesus H.
She left her phone downstairs.

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,321
How long ago did she leave?

92
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,128
Doesn't matter. She's back.

93
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,962
It's over. Our lead <i>asset</i>
is about to get burned.

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,726
Let's bring him in. This guy's
time is past due anyway.

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,087
I never trusted his bug eyes.

96
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,481
If we do that, it'll burn
Elliot's bridge to Tyrell.

97
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,369
It's about to be burned
anyway.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,041
Where are you going?

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,890
Don't look at me. Act normal.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,764
Elliot phished us.
He's in your apartment.

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,251
Stay cool,
don't blow your cover.

102
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,364
You said
you were leaving town.

103
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,001
What are you doing here?

104
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,648
Since when do you have
an apartment?

105
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,450
How can you afford this place?

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,727
None of your fucking
business. Leave.

107
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,008
I told you to walk away
from this.

108
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,004
And I told you to leave. We clearly
have communication issues.

109
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,445
Let's go.
You're coming with me.

110
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,284
We have to talk.
Not gonna happen.

111
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,850
I am not going
anywhere with you.

112
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,881
Last night, I noticed
some extra hardware

113
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,970
wired to my monitor's
display controller

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,807
along with a small cellular
modem taking screen shots

115
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,963
every ten seconds and sending
them out somewhere,

116
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,970
and now I'm standing here,
and I wanna know

117
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,730
why the fuck are you
hacking me?

118
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,564
Take another step,
and I will fucking scream.

119
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,324
You're not gonna
hurt me again.

120
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,481
And if it is him
that I'm talking to right now,

121
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,369
then yeah, I hacked you.

122
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,889
I don't trust you,
so back the fuck off.

123
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,841
Darlene...

124
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,281
It's me.

125
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,008
Yeah, well, that's a pretty
complicated statement

126
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,241
coming from you.

127
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,246
I'm not gonna hurt you.

128
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,085
Dom, get back here now.

129
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,161
Audios useless.

130
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,208
He's using a goddamn
voice protector.

131
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,050
You should've listened to me.

132
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,404
He is still here, and you
can't keep ignoring it.

133
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,126
Doesn't mean you hack me.

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,611
We don't do that
to each other.

135
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,090
You wouldn't talk to me. What
else was I supposed to do?

136
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,885
He's working with them,
isn't he?

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,765
I need to show you something.

138
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,121
Mm.

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,961
I know, I know,
ribs for breakfast,

140
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,761
but I can't pass 'em up
when I'm here.

141
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,131
You know,
the key is in the moisture.

142
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,885
Here, look.
See that pink in there'?

143
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,763
Red Wheelbarrow understands.

144
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,323
Mop sauce,
that's their secret.

145
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,927
Layman's version,
two tablespoons dry rub

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,923
to one cup
apple cider vinegar,

147
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,728
maybe beer, depends.

148
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,926
Then use a brush
to mop the ribs

149
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,770
during the cooking process.
Delicious.

150
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,530
You said we needed to talk.

151
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,765
Anyone tail you
on the way here?

152
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,809
SD Rs are now
second nature to me.

153
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,161
Did three cover stops,
nothing.

154
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,007
Oh, good.

155
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,970
Well, this is just a little
Monday morning

156
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,129
staff meeting update
kind of thing.

157
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,641
Today's Friday.

158
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,126
It was a figure of speech.

159
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,930
Point is I received
official word.

160
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,691
We go on September 29th,
ten days from now.

161
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,324
Now, you know how the boss
feels about timetables.

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,649
You said you can manage
those two knuckleheads,

163
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,006
and she put a lot
of faith in you.

164
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,444
I'm assuming you can make
this happen.

165
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,170
What about the shipping
delays?

166
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,610
Well, good thing we have
our guy on the inside, huh'?

167
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,001
Help speed things up.

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,441
Of course.

169
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,521
We'll make it happen.

170
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,081
Good.

171
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,011
I wanna be sure too.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,128
We've prepared
for an emergency evacuation

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,441
so no one will be
in the building when we go'?

174
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,886
I'm asking.

175
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,967
We have.

176
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,522
Keep us on schedule,
all will be good.

177
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,881
I have to ask...

178
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,769
did Whiterose ever show you?

179
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,887
YES.

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,561
And you believe in it?

181
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,802
Take a look at technology
nowadays.

182
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,121
It's mind-boggling.

183
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,127
Hell, these ribs.

184
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,526
You think it was even possible
to cook 'em as deliciously

185
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,011
as this a 100 years ago?

186
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,407
I mean, who knows
if this is even real meat?

187
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
As tasty as they are, I wouldn't be
surprised if they grew 'em in a lab.

188
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,049
I'm not talking about ribs.

189
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,040
My point is, I think
anything is possible.

190
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,691
Did he do this, or...

191
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,922
No, it was me.

192
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,444
I had to do a deep search,

193
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,444
make sure no one
was listening.

194
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,401
You were right.

195
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,409
Stage 2 was never called off.

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,600
ls Tyrell involved?

197
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,961
Has to be.

198
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,887
They're still trying to blow
up the recovery building.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,528
I've been monitoring
traffic at E Corp,

200
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,802
and that led me
to an unpatched web server.

201
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,769
Talk to me.
I'm trying to show you.

202
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,763
Ifs all right here
in my research.

203
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,970
Why are you monitoring them?

204
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,891
You could've taken
all of this,

205
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,088
sent it in as an anonymous tip
and walked away.

206
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,083
It's not that simple.
Yes, it is.

207
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,610
You don't want
to turn them in.

208
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,841
<i>Why'?</i>

209
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,650
Tell me what's going on.

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,808
I want to be the one
that finds them.

211
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,808
I need to see
where this leads.

212
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,841
What does that mean?

213
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,966
Elliot, listen to me.

214
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,042
This is not who you are.
You don't blow up buildings.

215
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,208
You don't hurt people.
I know.

216
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,120
What is this, then?

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,685
There's something inside me that
can't let go of what we started.

218
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,842
What we started is over.

219
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,529
Before, when I was here, you
said you wanted to stop this.

220
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,008
I need you to go back
to that place.

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,523
Tell me right now,
can you do that?

222
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,727
YES.

223
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,441
Good.

224
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,326
So with that in mind
and with what you have,

225
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,244
how do we find them and just
end this once and for all?

226
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,128
The best lead we've got is me.

227
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,408
She gave me her keys
when we were...

228
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,684
Landlord never changed
the locks,

229
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,046
and it's been vacant.

230
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,285
So what? You just...
come in here and hang?

231
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,567
I get it.

232
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,401
I haven't lost time
during the day,

233
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,846
but at night...

234
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,089
That's when you want me
to stay awake and keep watch

235
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,561
on the off chance
you turn into Mr. Hyde

236
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,246
and follow you to Tyrell
and the Dark Army.

237
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,201
Hey.

238
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,687
You're my brother.

239
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,966
I'm always here for you.

240
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,361
Besides, if you really think this
is the best way to find Tyrell...

241
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,008
it's weird, but I guess we passed
weird a long fucking time ago.

242
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,487
I'm in.

243
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,004
Shit, I have to get to work.

244
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,010
Whatever he does,

245
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,921
it's not me.

246
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,961
I know.

247
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,841
Come in.

248
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,325
<i>The last thing anyone wants
is some... </i>

249
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,640
<i>sleazy politician...</i>

250
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,521
<i>Oh, please, come.</i>

251
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,366
<i>It'll be great.</i>

252
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,002
<i>No, I...
How far is this place?</i>

253
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,491
<i>Just around the corner.</i>

254
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,561
<i>Oh, right,</i>

255
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,201
<i>well, I just wanted to say...

256
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,686
<i>Thank you
for the Christmas card.</i>

257
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,607
You're welcome.

258
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,403
<i>Look, I'm so sorry
about that day.</i>

259
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,722
<i>I came into the room,
and he slinked towards me,</i>

260
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,406
<i>and there was a fire, and he's the
President of the United States,</i>

261
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,051
<i>and nothing happened.
I promise.</i>

262
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,249
<i>And I just felt like
such a fool because...</i>

263
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,642
FBI, FBI! FBI!

264
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,001
On your fucking knees!
Hands behind your head!

265
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,526
Stay right there.

266
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,251
Don't you fucking move!

267
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,366
Don't move.

268
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,886
Don't you fucking move.

269
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,930
I sometimes wonder

270
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,729
<i>if I'd died
when Tyrell shot me,</i>

271
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,768
<i>would my revolution
have died with me?</i>

272
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,205
<i>At first, I thought
the Dark Army saved my life.</i>

273
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,121
<i>They didn't though.</i>

274
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,768
<i>They saved him, Mr. Robot.</i>

275
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,531
<i>And now he's trying to wage
a terrorist attack,</i>

276
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,806
<i>and that excites me.</i>

277
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,407
<i>Why?</i>

278
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,606
<i>Darlene's right.</i>

279
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,089
<i>I could've tipped off the FBI,
given them all this evidence</i>

280
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,446
<i>and let them handle it.</i>

281
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,769
<i>I could just go back to my
new TV and IKEA furniture.</i>

282
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,121
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

283
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,481
ANGELA; What's that?

284
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,000
Nothing, boring.

285
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,290
It's a scan, encrypt, archive.

286
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,570
It's the new consolidation.

287
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,324
Meetings next week, I think.

288
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,806
<i>That was a terrible lie.</i>

289
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,810
<i>There's no way
she believes me.</i>

290
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,641
Okay.

291
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,608
You're still coming
to the party tonight, right?

292
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,848
<i>I forgot that part
of being a corporate drone</i>

293
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,207
<i>is going to mandated
office functions.</i>

294
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,204
Yeah, definitely.

295
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,327
I wouldn't miss it.

296
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,761
Great.

297
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,851
One of these days, you gotta
pound that ass, dude.

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,048
Like, I've been out here
splashing everything in sight,

299
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,169
but it's starting to feel
a little lonely in p-town.

300
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,171
Don't let her slip away,
all right?

301
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,606
I need you on this.

302
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,768
<i>DiPIERRO: We know you posted
the fsociety video.</i>

303
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,522
With a court order, we got
the Vimeo connection logs

304
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,840
for the account you used,

305
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,045
which led us
to your IP address

306
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,451
and then your home address.

307
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,091
That's why
you're sitting here.

308
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,164
What my partner's trying to say
is you're on a path to a hell,

309
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,081
and we're not talking
the thousand virgins kind.

310
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,209
We're talking sharing
a prison shower

311
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,170
with a few Allah-hating Nazis
on the daily.

312
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,486
You're young.

313
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,690
Don't waste these years
behind bars.

314
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,328
All you gotta do is tell us
who's behind this.

315
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,885
Do you know Darlene Alderson?

316
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,801
Elliot Alderson,
do you know him?

317
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,166
Have you ever worked with him?

318
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,008
Tyrell Wellick,
is he your leader'?

319
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,400
The tough, quiet kind.

320
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,442
Boys in Gitmo find
your type especially cute.

321
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,567
White rose.

322
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,411
Is Whiterose your leader?

323
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,409
Mr. Nouri, when I get bored,
I get very teed off,

324
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,530
and this silent treatment of
yours is a straight-up sedative.

325
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,408
So this is the last time
I'm gonna ask you,

326
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,008
and I urge you this time,
do not bore me.

327
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,046
Who is your leader?

328
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,440
Fsociety.

329
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,887
Just me.

330
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
Could have fooled me.

331
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,801
What's with the Armani
Exchange getup?

332
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,449
I came from a work party.

333
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,087
Copy that.

334
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,720
You good for the night?

335
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,646
You sure you can stay up'?

336
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,524
Just did an eight ball,
so I'm golden.

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,771
Maybe we should have
some sort of signal

338
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,844
when I'm coming and going
so you know it's me.

339
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,481
How about you just tell me?

340
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,761
That's a good signal.

341
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,606
Good night.
Wait, are you going to sleep?

342
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,763
I was gonna walk
Flipper first.

343
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,810
Cool, I'll come with.

344
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,562
Okay, so, just thinking
out loud, but...

345
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,328
if I do follow him
and find Tyrell

346
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,246
and the Dark Army
and shit goes down,

347
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,687
like, bad shit,
you'd get vengeance, right'?

348
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,046
Like, if I die or something,
you'll kill whoever did it,

349
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,805
and, obviously,
I'll do the same for you.

350
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,804
Like, like a vengeance pact.

351
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,041
Is that even a thing?

352
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,120
It can be our thing.

353
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,561
You in?

354
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,811
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

355
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,201
Cool.

356
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,681
Darlene...

357
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,041
I'm sorry.

358
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,728
I treated you like shit
for weeks.

359
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,731
I shouldn't have been
pushing you away.

360
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,484
You're my fucking sister.

361
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,126
I should've believed you.

362
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,084
<i>We've got the fsociety
video traced</i>

363
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,605
right to that asshole's
apartment.

364
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,566
We got more than half the FBI
across the country

365
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,928
chasing Tyrell Wellick,
and you're asking that yahoo

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,641
about the mythical Whiterose from
the land of Dark Web Fairy Tales?

367
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,011
Come on, Dom, Whiterose is a boogie
man story for the Dark Army.

368
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,841
Groups like these
don't have leaders.

369
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,769
The Dark Army isn't like
any other group.

370
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,050
And I'm tired of being the only one that
questions their involvement in this.

371
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,966
No doubt they're involved, but this
video is fsociety to the bone,

372
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,964
and ever since
we picked up our guy,

373
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,883
fsociety chatter
is off the charts.

374
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,448
Makes sense if they're planning
to make good on their threat,

375
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,085
and we just snagged
one of their operatives.

376
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,961
This guy practically
handed us his location.

377
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,001
I don't like it.

378
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,449
Okay, but isn't every
Dark Army member

379
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,649
trained to pull a trigger on
themselves in lieu of getting caught?

380
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,646
Why'd he surrender?

381
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,483
I checked
with the other facilities.

382
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,291
Elliot's been rerouting the
shipments all over the country.

383
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,610
No, no, no, no, no, no!

384
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,285
Why am I even surprised?

385
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,804
I told you this would happen.

386
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,765
You know him.
You know he can't be trusted.

387
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,365
He's behind
the shipping delays.

388
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,805
This explains everything.

389
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,201
This manifest
was a fucking mirage.

390
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,611
And on top of that, you've
agreed to a new timeline?

391
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,762
That was before
I knew about all of this.

392
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,680
I came here to talk about
our options.

393
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,162
Options? We have no
fucking options!

394
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,090
What happened
to your perfect plan?

395
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,682
You placed him at E Corp to speed up
the consolidation, not to stop it.

396
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,000
We're worse off
than where we started.

397
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,844
Why did you even let him
work there in the first place?

398
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,649
It was the best way
to manage him.

399
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,805
This doesn't change anything.

400
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,970
This can still be salvaged.

401
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,008
This is all your fault.

402
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,120
No, it's all his fault.

403
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,483
The Dark Army needs to know
what he's done.

404
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,964
You know that you can't
tell them.

405
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,883
You understand
the consequences.

406
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,844
And not just for Elliot,
for all of us.

407
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,763
Well, maybe I can reason
with them.

408
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,643
Never appeal
to a man's better nature.

409
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,126
He may not have one.

410
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,930
This isn't impossible.

411
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,208
We arrange to have
the western-most states

412
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,611
ship their records by plane.

413
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,409
Our trucks will handle
the East Coast.

414
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,891
We just need to stay focused.

415
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,009
Everyone will notice the trucks.
It will draw too much attention.

416
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,730
If we move the paper
over the weekend,

417
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,450
we can operate
under the radar.

418
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,931
In the meantime, I'll have
Elliot's access revoked

419
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,364
to make sure that he doesn't
interfere again.

420
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,487
What?

421
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,602
You can promise
this motherfucker

422
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,281
won't stop us again when he
wakes up in the morning?

423
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,645
You can talk to me.

424
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,281
Okay.

425
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,123
Face it, Elliot, if that's who
I'm even talking to.

426
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,522
We work nights together for over
six weeks to prepare this project,

427
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,804
but you spend your days ruining
all we've accomplished.

428
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,884
You, as a person, make no sense.
You're a liability.

429
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,849
Our goal hasn't changed.

430
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,843
I can't follow
this back-and-forth anymore.

431
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,001
You had one simple directive.

432
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,811
To maintain control
until the plan was executed.

433
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,605
It doesn't work that way.
There's no on/off switch.

434
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,808
Then tell me,
how does it work?

435
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,481
'Cause I don't even know which
Elliot I'm talking to right now.

436
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,688
How it works is I am here now.

437
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,208
Don't forget
whose operation this is.

438
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,490
I once thought
you to be a God.

439
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,161
I loved you.

440
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,842
But now I see how foolish I
was and how inferior you are.

441
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,089
Like a fucking cockroach.

442
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,890
You messed up
for the last time.

443
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,610
I'm taking over. So, no.

444
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,409
This is no longer
your operation.

445
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,606
This is mine.

446
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,130
Listen to me,
you Swedish scumfuck.

447
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,606
This is my revolution.

448
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,127
I am the architect.
Do you understand?

449
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,440
The only reason you are here

450
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,045
is because
I allowed you to be.

451
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,205
Don't forget I could've
pulled that trigger twice.

452
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,003
He is fucking crazy.
I want him out, out!

453
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,809
He's unfit to run this op.

454
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,201
YOU Okay?

455
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,247
Hey.

456
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,928
Look me in the eyes and
tell me that you're okay.

457
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,761
Shit.

458
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,966
What's happening?

459
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,246
He's here.

460
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,681
Angela?

461
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,926
Why is he here?

462
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,768
Hey, it's okay.

463
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,286
What are you doing?
Calm down.

464
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,761
<i>Where am</i> I?

465
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,691
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be...

466
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,488
<i>Please tell me
you know what's happening.</i>

467
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,406
It's okay.

468
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,164
<i>Just tell me
you know what's happening.</i>

469
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,764
<i>Please, tell me you know
what's happening.</i>

470
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,370
<i>Tell me you know
what's happening.</i>

471
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,121
Tell me you have something.

472
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,206
Buy me a drink.

473
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,961
I've been covering your ass
the last week.

474
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,611
You disappeared.
All I've gotten is one text

475
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,284
saying you might have
a development,

476
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,731
and now you want me
to buy you a drink?

477
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,282
You almost got me busted
by my own brother, remember'?

478
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,600
Yeah, I'm still butthurt about
that, in case you were wondering.

479
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,250
And you never told us
what you two talked about

480
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,810
when he came
to the safe house.

481
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,286
Yeah, well, maybe I'm just
tired of being a traitor.

482
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,728
Maybe I just wanna be
a normal person

483
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,201
for one fucking minute, okay'?

484
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,161
So how about you buy me...

485
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,161
a drink?

486
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,001
You know I could get in trouble for
meeting up with you like this,

487
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,206
one-on-one?

488
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,123
You're supposed to be
at the safe house.

489
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,929
Yeah, well,
we tried it your way,

490
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,082
and Elliot ended up
almost making us.

491
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,524
Okay, now we're trying it
my way.

492
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,767
What'll you have?

493
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,128
Bourbon, Eagle Rare, neat.

494
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,760
On her tab.

495
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,851
Okay, you got your drink.
Now tell me what else you got.

496
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,481
You said you're from Jersey.
What part?

497
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,085
I don't have time
for Q and As.

498
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,601
My way, remember?
I need to know what you have.

499
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,523
Well, I'll tell you
what I don't have.

500
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,411
I have no friends.

501
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,849
I have no social contact.

502
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,366
I have no life because of you.

503
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,203
Now, you said
you're from Jersey.

504
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,649
You don't fucking say.

505
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,047
What part?

506
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,208
The world-renowned town
of Teaneck.

507
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,440
Siblings?
Two brothers.

508
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,971
Relationship status?

509
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,570
How many of these do I have
to go through?

510
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,044
Relationship status?

511
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,361
Okay'...

512
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,404
On again off again
with someone,

513
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,240
but they're not really the one
or anything like that.

514
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,685
Ah...

515
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,123
The old pronoun game.

516
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,768
I experimented
with that for a bit.

517
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,848
It's all good with me.

518
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,081
Thanks for your approval.

519
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,607
Ifs 2015 now.
Why the coded dialog'?

520
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,046
FBI doesn't approve
of muff-divers?

521
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,330
Let's just say
it keeps things simple.

522
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,447
Whatever diddles your skittle.

523
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,961
What about you?

524
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,682
Well, my last relationship
didn't end very well.

525
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,450
You were there, remember'?

526
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,201
Shit.

527
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,962
This is why
I don't do the social thing.

528
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,804
Darlene, I get
this is tough for you.

529
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,802
We've got a lot of intel
that says something

530
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,042
is happening and soon.

531
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,284
From the looks of it,
it could be big.

532
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,209
We need to get Tyrell
before it's too late,

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,644
which means you need to tell
me if you know something.

534
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,130
I think I have a lead,
but I need to go at it alone

535
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,322
without a wire.
That's not gonna happen.

536
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,842
Well, tough titties, it's the
only way I'm doing this.

537
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,087
Because when I do this,

538
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,562
and you're all popping Cristal
after you land Tyrell,

539
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,165
understand something...

540
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,645
it's game over for me.

541
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,442
I may have immunity,
but I'm gonna lose my brother.

542
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,329
No can do, Kathmandu.

543
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,640
This needs to happen
by Monday.

544
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,131
But I can't work with him
anymore.

545
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,407
Elliot is dead to me.
Our partnership is over.

546
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,050
Uh-huh, and...

547
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,761
Shipping paper records
from 71 buildings

548
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,161
across the country to New York
over this weekend?

549
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,965
It would draw too much
attention.

550
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,042
That sounds like a YP,
not an MP.

551
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
I don't know what to tell you.

552
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,888
Whiterose is strict
about her schedule.

553
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,201
Be reasonable.

554
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,006
I'm back at the beginning.

555
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,001
Give me more time.

556
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,123
As I said, has to happen
on Monday.

557
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,965
Why the change in deadline?
You knew there were delays.

558
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,088
This mad rush isn't worth
the risk.

559
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,891
You keep squawking as if I'm gonna
give you a different answer.

560
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,086
Look, you get this done,
we all take a nice vacation.

561
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,727
I've been looking for some
time to finish my book.

562
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,801
You don't understand.

563
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,206
I lost my partner.

564
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,080
We were supposed to be gods
together, but it's over.

565
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,000
Tyrell, I get that you
and Elliot are having...

566
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,964
interpersonal issues.

567
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,449
Sometimes coworkers find
that they aren't the right fit

568
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,608
but they still gotta finish
the job, you know?

569
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,641
Besides, you and I both
know this has nothing

570
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,449
to do with Elliot being a god.

571
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,323
If he is no longer with you,
if he cannot finish the job,

572
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,650
well, that proves one thing.

573
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,331
You are the god, not him.

574
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,441
And I am damn confident
that you will find a solution

575
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,846
to our timing issue.

576
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,248
You were destined
for this, Tyrell.

577
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,165
This is your moment.

578
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,408
This is the moment
you were born for.

579
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,129
You cannot turn away now.

580
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,807
YES.

581
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,601
There is a way.

582
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,282
First, the baby monitor.

583
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,731
I haven't been able
to connect in weeks.

584
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,245
They must've set up
a new system.

585
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,766
Regardless, I want to see them
in person instead.

586
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,011
My wife, my son, and I

587
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,287
will go to the Ukraine,
together,

588
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,367
on Monday after the plan
is complete.

589
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,850
They don't extradite
to the U.S.

590
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,687
I want your word.

591
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,881
I'll get into that.

592
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,001
Okay.

593
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,049
Do me a favor
and check on Joanna.

594
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,731
I've been reading online,
and it seems

595
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,126
she's been maintaining
a low profile.

596
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,727
Make sure she's okay
and inform her of the plan.

597
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,486
Of course.

598
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,447
And Irving?

599
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,851
There's one last thing I need
in order to execute.

600
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,841
What's that?

601
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,448
The full force
of the Dark Army.

602
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,688
Your message said
this was urgent.

603
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,126
I'm coming to you because I don't
have just cause for this request,

604
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,530
<i>But I need it
to happen quickly.</i>

605
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,727
Go on.

606
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,923
I need you to fire
Elliot Alderson.

607
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,649
<i>Ban him from any and all</i>

608
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,087
<i>E Corp branches
and subsidiaries.</i>

609
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,606
And why do you want me
to fire him?

610
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,211
<i>I have my reasons.</i>

611
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,001
Explaining them won't help,
but my discretion on them

612
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,286
is important to me.

613
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,884
And you're comfortable
making this decision?

614
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,450
Mr. Price, I know this random
employee doesn't matter to you.

615
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,601
He's just a number.

616
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,690
You can continue
to question me

617
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,285
because you seek
my true reasons,

618
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,561
or you can deny my request

619
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,846
because I'm overreaching.

620
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,720
But I'll return the favor.

621
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,801
<i>You know I'm good for it.</i>

622
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,206
<i>If you want my reasons,</i>

623
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,009
<i>I'll have to restate
what I said.</i>

624
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,961
<i>They are mine,</i>

625
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,528
and my discretion on them
is important.

626
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,807
And this is your request?

627
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,401
It is.

628
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,246
Consider it done.

629
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,641
Thank you.

630
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,281
You still there?

631
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,365
Yes, it's me.

632
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,922
Relax, I said it's me.

633
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,081
How are you feeling?

634
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,045
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

635
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,047
We've been over this.
Elliot saw everything.

636
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,131
I had to knock him out,
and now we're here.

637
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,163
I was asking
about your phone call.

638
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,046
We're good to go.

639
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,726
Price said yes,

640
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,289
but you're staying here
this weekend.

641
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,365
Can't have any more
accidents.

642
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,371
He's gonna wake up again.

643
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,522
He saw you and Tyrell.

644
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,769
He only saw us
for a few seconds.

645
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,205
Maybe he won't remember.

646
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,648
And, if he does,
I'll handle it.

647
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,122
You just do what you do best.

648
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,962
Fight him off.

649
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,690
I told you
this would happen.

650
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,722
I told you that he would
find a way to stop us.

651
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,324
Stage 2 has been
completely derailed.

652
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,681
What is it?

653
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,926
Irving.

654
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,922
He says we'll be ready
to go on Monday.

655
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,481
Open up.

656
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,208
Any day, dude, it's me.

657
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,721
Elliot?
