1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,247
<i>Everywhere I look
you're there.</i>

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,561
<i>That is why
I wanted to meet.</i>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,846
<i>So I could find out</i>

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,605
why you are so special
to Phillip Price.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,807
Why come after me?

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,006
Your pet project

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,525
<i>Angela Moss was allowed</i>

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,011
to continue
with her lawsuit

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>which put my plans
in jeopardy.</i>

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,808
We're not safe here.
I have to warn her.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,365
<i>She has to know
what they heard.</i>

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,046
Ms. Moss. Ms. Moss, I'm gonna
need you to come with us.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,121
We're ready.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,929
<i>My exploit
will give me full access</i>

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,490
<i>to their management
interface.</i>

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,005
<i>Now I own the Dark Army.</i>

17
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,683
I suppose there's
some banal excuse

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,006
why a month
isn't enough time

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,764
to get my project shipped
to the Congo?

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,844
<i>Trenton's right. Encryption keys
were exported the night of the hack.</i>

21
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,371
Why would Romero do this?

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,249
<i>He did it for the
reason we need those keys now,</i>

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,004
<i>in case our revolution failed.</i>

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,320
Bang!

25
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,210
I don't trust him. ELLIOT:
AH of his state's

26
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,408
<i>in the FBI evidence
storage system.</i>

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,211
The FBI. The Dark Army
has a man on the inside.

28
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,163
<i>I'll hit up my contact.
We can't trust them.</i>

29
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,084
<i>I might have an angle.
DiPIERRO: She was in my home</i>

30
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,089
<i>attempting to steal my badge
to get on Sentinel.</i>

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,124
There are files that can help
decrypt all of E Cam's data.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,361
What's the plan here?

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,566
She talks like
she knows everything.

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,005
<i>How do you want to proceed?</i>

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,889
<i>We haven't seen
each other in months.</i>

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,002
<i>We've been battling each other
in our own voids.</i>

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,731
When we were kids, Darlene
and I, we made this snowman.

38
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,650
<i>That was the day my dad
pushed me out the window.</i>

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,206
You remember when we made
Kevin McCallister?

40
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,770
Do you want to talk about it'?

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,285
<i>Do you remember
when you said</i>

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,249
<i>Elliot would one day follow</i>

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,527
<i>in the footsteps
of his father?</i>

44
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,769
I think it's time
he died for us, too.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,125
<i>Darlene's not
responding to any of my texts.</i>

46
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,645
<i>If Dark Army's targeting me,</i>

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,210
<i>then they're gonna
target her next.</i>

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,645
<i>Hopefully, she made it
to our rendezvous.</i>

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,846
Wake up.

50
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,763
Let's go.
You're coming with me.

51
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,002
Finally you guys came
to your sen...

52
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,728
Dude, what the fuck?
Shut up.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,643
Are you seriously gonna
arrest me right now?

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,927
I told you we can
fix this, okay?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,480
Let's just log into Sentinel.
I said shut the fuck up.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,765
Ifs the EC and 302 from
last night, the Alderson case.

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,285
I just submitted it
for upload.

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,481
Why are you giving me this'?

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,923
Uh, sorry, Santiago
must not have told you.

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,362
You're on the Alderson arrest.
I brought her in last night.

61
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,530
No clue what
you're talking about.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,125
I'm headed to JFK in 20.

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,005
Got a flight
to San Fran today.

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,890
Santiago!

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,366
What are you doing?

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,966
Taking her to holding.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,084
I thought you were putting
Agent Kaz on this.

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,161
Why are you
doing this yourself'?

69
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,241
The ADIC wanted
her in holding.

70
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,049
That's what I'm doing.
Get back inside.

71
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,884
Fine, I'll take it up
with the ADIC then.

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
Are you gonna finally tell me
what the fuck is going on?

73
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,369
I can't talk to you
about it, Dom.

74
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,851
You're not authorized to know.

75
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,650
There's intel you're not privy
to that's connected to this.

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,688
I'd be more comfortable if
we took it up with the ADIC.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,402
If you want to call him,
you can.

78
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,925
But I...

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,844
I just don't want you
to embarrass yourself.

80
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,051
What?

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,851
Are you scared of me now?

82
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,010
There are cameras everywhere.

83
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,969
You really think
I'm going to do...

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,366
<i>She's not here.</i>

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,731
<i>Mr. Robot's note.</i>

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,366
<i>If what he said is true and
the Dark Army owns the FBI,</i>

87
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,771
<i>then maybe she ran into them</i>

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,888
<i>while she was trying
to access Sentinel.</i>

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,081
<i>Shit.</i>

90
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,924
<i>Dark Army has dozens
of operatives</i>

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,729
<i>who live in and around
Manhattan.</i>

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,768
<i>Combing through their command
and control server</i>

93
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,126
<i>is going to take too long.</i>

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,249
<i>There are over 600,000
compromised systems on here.</i>

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,205
<i>I can't go through every one.</i>

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,124
<i>I don't even know
what I'm searching for.</i>

97
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,606
<i>I need something to go on.</i>

98
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,287
<i>A name, place,
something, anything.</i>

99
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,401
<i>Think, think, think.
What do I know?</i>

100
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,763
<i>Anything you can remember?
Any detail?</i>

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,564
<i>Anything. Tell me something.</i>

102
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,768
<i>Don't you get it?
She's gonna die.</i>

103
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,362
<i>Darlene's gonna die.
She's gonna die.</i>

104
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,363
<i>She's gonna fucking die
like everyone else.</i>

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,564
<i>I should have never done this.</i>

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,570
<i>I should have left this alone.</i>

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,411
<i>I'll never learn.</i>

108
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,690
<i>I brought this on myself.</i>

109
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,050
<i>I'll never learn.</i>

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,405
<i>This is on me.</i>

111
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,691
<i>This is on me.</i>

112
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,685
For how many'?

113
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,250
One.

114
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,288
So, Ferris wheel.

115
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,411
Cute touch.

116
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,248
I need information from you.

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,529
You do not get to summon me
like you're Ali Babe,

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,921
squeeze me for information then
shove me back in some lamp.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,365
Darlene's in trouble!

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,965
She might already be dead.

121
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,610
The whole reason you're
in this goddamn mess

122
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,205
is because we're
not working together,

123
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,487
because you refuse
to talk to me.

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,971
I wish that were true.

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,365
The sick part is...

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,650
I actually missed you.

127
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,962
The only reason
we haven't been talking...

128
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,084
ls because I haven't
let myself.

129
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,684
'Cause I've been
scared of you.

130
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,201
The part of... me that is you.

131
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,730
Why are we talking now'?

132
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,970
The 71 buildings.

133
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,210
I didn't know about that.

134
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,842
If you did,
would you have done it'?

135
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,685
Would you have done it?

136
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,524
I would have...

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,203
I would have found
another way.

138
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,002
Because as much as there
is a part of you in me...

139
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,888
There is a part of me in you.

140
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,648
Your note on the mirror,
what did you mean by it?

141
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,326
What do you know?

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,289
I need to find Darlene.

143
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,805
Tell me what you know.

144
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,600
The FBI...

145
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,126
has a mole.

146
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,604
You piece of shit.

147
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,531
The attack in China.

148
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,122
While you were hiding
in your room,

149
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,124
knowing the rest of us
were getting blown to pieces.

150
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,931
Cisco.

151
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,810
You helped them get to him
before we did, didn't you?

152
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,888
And the Tyrell cover-up.

153
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,850
You helped frame...

154
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,802
Markesh and Biswas.

155
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,126
This whole time, we've been
punching ourselves in the face

156
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,804
because of you!

157
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,084
All I know is, if you were
put in my position...

158
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,403
Nothing would make me betray
everything I stand for.

159
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,487
You know one thing I'll say
about you, DiPierro,

160
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,642
your naivete is adorable.

161
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,367
It's easy for you to play
a hero in the backseat,

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,408
but that's all world's ever
amounted to.

163
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
The backseat.

164
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
The things I did.

165
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,049
I mean, the... The things
that I have to do...

166
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,682
Are you seriously trying
to paint yourself a saint now

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,921
after what you've put us
through?

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,082
You know, the only reason
your girlfriend here is alive

169
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,845
is because I never told the
Dark Army she was a CHS.

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,170
Believe or not,
I'm not a bad guy, DiPierro.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,606
You don't understand
what they put me through.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,527
What they hold over me,
but you will.

173
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,691
Soon enough.

174
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,531
There's
the cocksucker.

175
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,205
Dead center.

176
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,010
According to Wellick,

177
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,570
he's been working both sides
the whole time.

178
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,565
Probably the reason we didn't
get pegged for Five/Nine.

179
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,969
We gotta find a way
to trace him.

180
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,969
Why don't we jump
on his desktop?

181
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,801
I already did that remotely,
nothing useful.

182
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,248
Which means whatever
we're looking for is physical.

183
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,290
Number sets.

184
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,965
It's another cipher code.

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,929
Not this shit again.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,684
This has gotta give us
a location.

187
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,487
Elliot.
Just give me a minute.

188
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,607
Elliot.

189
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,085
Just finished this book.

190
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,971
I got it on tape.

191
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,930
Didn't care much
for the ending.

192
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,166
I mean, a story can have
a mediocre beginning

193
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,891
and middle,
and oftentimes it does,

194
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,042
but always got to have
a wow ending.

195
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,690
Otherwise, what's the point?

196
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,326
Shit.

197
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,091
<i>If he's here that means
they must have Darlene.</i>

198
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,481
<i>Maybe I can manipulate him
into helping us.</i>

199
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,087
<i>Quick.</i>

200
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,083
<i>What do we know about...
Whatever scheme</i>

201
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,728
you're trying to come up
with right now

202
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,451
It ain't gonna change
the inevitable, so...

203
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,125
I strongly recommend
you choose the easy way here

204
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,281
and come with me.

205
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,326
How'd you sleep last night?

206
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,247
I didn't.

207
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,966
I've been waiting all night.

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,282
I need to see her
as soon as possible.

209
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,362
I have important information
for her.

210
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,242
It's a beautiful day,
don't you think'?

211
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,650
LOOK.

212
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,650
There are people
that are trying to stop her.

213
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,321
I need to tell her.

214
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,088
Oh, I'm just
the house manager.

215
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,447
But you can discuss that with
Mr. Price when he arrives.

216
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,644
I thought we'd get some
breakfast first.

217
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,521
Do you like pancakes?

218
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,606
It's this way.

219
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,882
Elliot.
Don't fucking move.

220
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,450
We are walking into some
fucking hillbilly shit here.

221
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,201
Now, look.

222
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,647
I know this is all fucked up,
but it's salvageable.

223
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,005
There's a lot of clean-up
at the FBI

224
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,610
you're going to have
to take care of for me.

225
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,806
Mmm-hmm.

226
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,011
So this is the plus-one
you've been squawking about?

227
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,248
You're not turning this
around on me.

228
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,049
Not after the fucking day
I've had,

229
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,885
cleaning up your mess
once again.

230
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,803
I'm over it.
You hear me?

231
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,970
It's high time you guys start

232
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,804
cleaning up my mess
for a change.

233
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
Uh-huh.

234
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,008
And by "mess" I assume
you mean her.

235
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,085
I know how to fix this.

236
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,491
So do I.

237
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,641
All right.

238
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,324
Come on, Miss, let's go.

239
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,689
Leon, you got this?

240
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,645
Yeah, I got it.

241
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,531
Are you okay?

242
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,965
Is that a joke?

243
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,008
We're in a fucking barn out
in the middle of nowhere

244
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,003
with a handful
of psychos.

245
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,170
"No" is the answer.

246
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,806
DiPIERRO: Listen, sir.

247
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,564
I don't know what you
think I did, but...

248
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,806
This guy's a liability to you.
He's gotten sloppy.

249
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,405
You don't have to do this.
Dom.

250
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,130
My bosses know
about everything.

251
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,362
There's security camera
footage of him kidnapping

252
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,726
Ms. Alderson and me...
Miss.

253
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,887
Stop talking, huh'?

254
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,763
Okay, we got two operatives.

255
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,047
Leon's pretty good
with a knife.

256
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,605
What are you thinking?

257
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,683
I'm not trying to escape.

258
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,808
Elliot, these guys aren't
fucking around.

259
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,523
Who do you think you're going
to talk to out here?

260
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,806
Who do you think?

261
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,691
White rose.

262
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,762
You've played
that game already.

263
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,490
She doesn't want to see you.

264
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,282
She's seeing us right now.

265
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,651
Fuck me.

266
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,206
Now wait a minute.

267
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
Let's just slow things
down a bit.

268
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,360
We can flip her.

269
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,885
She can be very valuable.

270
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,644
No way I'm flipping.
Dom.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,006
Don't be stupid.
Listen to me.

272
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,963
I'm trying to get you out
of this alive.

273
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,525
Valuable, huh?

274
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,246
You think she would've gone
far in the Bureau?

275
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,482
She would have been one
of the youngest ASACs ever,

276
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,006
still could be.
No, she's a rising star.

277
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,966
Gumption.

278
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,005
But it's like she said,

279
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,010
no way she's flipping.

280
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,851
Hey.

281
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,527
Oh, no, no, don't get
too worked up, Miss.

282
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,764
Just look at the sky.

283
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,890
Take a deep breath.

284
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,370
Try to enjoy the fresh air.

285
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,850
Wait, wait, wait. Dom.

286
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,604
Just tell him you'll flip.

287
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,090
This isn't worth it.
You can...

288
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,491
Oh, don't mind that.

289
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,163
We're retiring
this shit-stain.

290
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,885
And you're taking his place.

291
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,850
You work for
the Dark Army now.

292
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,367
You're gonna go back
to the FBI.

293
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,528
It's gonna be business
as usual.

294
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,129
You're gonna feed us
any information

295
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,770
and answer all our requests.

296
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,801
Fuck you.
Now, Dom.

297
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,762
You're gonna need to get your head
around the position you're in here.

298
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,886
I'm no traitor.

299
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,285
You should kill me now

300
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,124
because the first thing I do

301
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,481
when you let me go is arrest
your fucking ass.

302
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,691
The name of your youngest
family member,

303
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,691
what is it?

304
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,405
Oh, that's right.

305
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,045
Four-year-old Jamie DiPierro
of Morrisville.

306
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,283
That's your brother
Joseph's kid, right'?

307
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,201
Yeah.

308
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,326
I want you to look
at this jerk-off

309
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,122
and imagine it's little Jamie.

310
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,605
Now I want you to imagine
your morn Trudie,

311
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,011
in Philly.

312
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,170
Now imagine Uncle Chris
one morning

313
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,129
as he's picking up his copy

314
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,170
<i>of the Dallas Morning Star!</i>

315
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,684
Or you're older brother,
Jerry,

316
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,524
while he's watching

317
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,002
<i>Wheel... of... Fortune!</i>

318
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,562
Am I illustrating my point'?

319
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,449
Dom, I'm going
to need verbal confirmation

320
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,842
that you're grasping the
details of this agreement!

321
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,805
Okay.

322
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,364
Okay.

323
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,805
In time,

324
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,882
this will get easier
to live with.

325
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,765
I promise.

326
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,563
Head into the barn
and await further instructions

327
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,325
on how to clear up
Santiago's missteps.

328
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,884
Now, forgive me

329
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,647
while I take a moment
to center myself.

330
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,204
This next bunch...

331
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,089
These are for me.

332
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,962
Jesus, Dom, what happened?

333
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,567
Looks like she's just got
her initiation.

334
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,964
Want some of
this catnip, girl'?

335
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,282
All right.
Suit yourself.

336
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,884
All right, if we don't figure
out a way to get out of here,

337
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,325
they are going to kill us.

338
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,965
Look around you.

339
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,964
They've been instructed
to wait.

340
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,606
Not act.

341
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,409
Wait for what?

342
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,761
They're preparing for someone
important to come.

343
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,370
I took care of everything.

344
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,085
As instructed.

345
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,724
Everyone's loaded up
in the barn.

346
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,489
You might want
to send your guys

347
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,767
to the woodpile over there.

348
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,244
I had to kill the FBI mole.

349
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,440
That's the bad news.

350
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,406
Good news, I got you
someone even better.

351
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,091
She doesn't have
as high of a rank,

352
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,242
but she's got
tremendous upside.

353
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,846
Besides...

354
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,564
That guy was a dickhead.

355
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,641
Anyway.

356
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,411
She's in the barn as well.

357
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,406
Where are you going?

358
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,564
Me, I'm gonna take
that overdue sabbatical

359
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,091
I keep talking about.

360
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,087
Finally get to finish my book.

361
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,763
Well, that's the goal anyway.

362
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,161
I'm thinking the Sandals
in Barbados.

363
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,004
They got a good special
running this month.

364
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,089
You are
not going anywhere.

365
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,888
We have work to do.

366
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,251
Tell me something.

367
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,126
She still making
her spontaneous overtures?

368
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,761
She make you taste her yet?

369
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,691
Remember, doll face,

370
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,003
I was you years ago.

371
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,004
And I've already done my time.

372
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,365
I think she'll be good
with me.

373
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,886
Glad we did this.

374
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,125
I want to leave.

375
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,325
My staff not keeping
you comfortable?

376
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,002
I wouldn't have come

377
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,648
if I had known
this was your house.

378
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,643
I was getting concerned
about you.

379
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,284
Hadn't been to work for weeks,

380
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,846
you're not answering
your phone, your emails.

381
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,811
I sent someone
to your apartment.

382
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,841
When I saw what you
were doing, I felt I...

383
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,605
I had to intervene.

384
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,805
<i>I'm not
supposed to be here.</i>

385
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,166
And where do you think
you're supposed to be?

386
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,646
You know where.

387
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,801
With her.

388
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,406
She has a plan.

389
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,371
Yes, I've known about
her delusional plan for years.

390
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,846
You don't know anything.

391
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,645
<i>Mr. Alderson.</i>

392
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,724
I had a chance to review
your paperwork for Stage 3.

393
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,802
Surprisingly...
It's bullshit.

394
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,526
There is no Stage 3,
but you already knew that.

395
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
I'm glad we can be honest.

396
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,205
Now we can talk.

397
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,960
The only reason
you're involved in any of this

398
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,607
is because I had Colby
hire you.

399
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,082
I needed to manipulate you
into dropping

400
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,527
that contingency
from your lawsuit.

401
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,090
You were threatening
her plant.

402
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,489
And she would have
done anything

403
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,882
to stop those inspections,
including killing you.

404
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,284
Why would you care
if she killed me?

405
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,362
You don't care about anyone
but yourself.

406
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,520
Let go of them.

407
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,009
Then we can talk.

408
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,287
But if I didn't have her

409
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,091
then how am I going
to keep you honest?

410
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,445
I own everything.

411
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,811
I own every single system
the Dark Army has compromised.

412
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
I met your mother.

413
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,371
Emily.

414
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,490
Thirty two years ago.

415
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,684
When you took my laptop,

416
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,162
you infected yourself
with my malware.

417
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,650
If you hurt her,

418
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,890
it will all get released.

419
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,046
Every bribe, blackmail,
extortion, operation,

420
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,884
all your illegal connections,

421
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,564
everything will go public.

422
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,120
The entire Dark Army history.

423
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,569
That's impossible.

424
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,126
And here I thought
we were going to be honest.

425
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,961
<i>We were both
working at E Corp.</i>

426
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,171
We dated for quite some time.

427
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,930
Seven days ago,
the Russian government

428
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,570
hired you to hack
the DNC.

429
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,642
Elliot.
Two days before that,

430
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,087
you bribed the president of
South Korea to allow backdoors

431
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,764
in all
of their military networks.

432
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,047
You're just pissing him off.
Three weeks before that,

433
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,522
you used Phillip Price
to annex the Congo for China.

434
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,842
Am I being more honest now?

435
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,926
I loved her.

436
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,166
Deep?!'-

437
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,045
But I never told her.

438
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,887
If one of us dies,
everything gets leaked.

439
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,202
Well, we can survive a leak.

440
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,171
You can't survive a bullet
through your throat.

441
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,761
The closer we became,
the more I held back.

442
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,763
I was cruel to her

443
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,686
in that way.

444
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,922
It made me feel strong...

445
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,403
To torture her like that...
like that.

446
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,808
We have an opportunity
for both of us

447
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,089
to leave with what we want.
I know exactly what you want.

448
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,288
You want to reverse Five! Nine.

449
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,367
And honestly we couldn't
careless about that.

450
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,091
Ifs already served
its purpose.

451
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,807
When she told me
she was pregnant,

452
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,527
she was very emphatic
that her child

453
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,801
wasn't going to
be raised by a monster,

454
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,450
as she put it.

455
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,726
No!

456
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,367
I also know how to move
whatever project you have

457
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,131
in the Washington
Township Plant to the Congo.

458
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,845
While you sit back,

459
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,607
missing your deadlines,
doing nothing,

460
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,123
I've engineered a hack that
can solve all of your problems

461
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,202
and I'm willing
to give it to you.

462
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,770
Do you hear me?

463
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,888
I can move your projects
to the Congo!

464
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,769
You'll get what you want!

465
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,888
We won't bother you anymore!

466
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,361
Sometime after that
she met and then...

467
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,489
She married your father.

468
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,929
Who agreed to raise you
as his own.

469
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,368
<i>You're very
sure of yourself.</i>

470
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,408
You are just one hacker.

471
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,563
What makes you believe
that you are better

472
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,530
than an army of people
exactly like you?

473
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,885
Because I am.

474
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,971
I did something in one night

475
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,527
you've been trying to pull off
for months.

476
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,367
I never planned
on telling you,

477
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,649
until I realized what
Whiterose had done to you.

478
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,442
Look, it's not possible

479
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,080
what she's talking about.

480
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,562
Angela, this so-called project
of hers,

481
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,929
it stems from an obsessive,
psychotic denial of reality.

482
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,925
Don't do this.

483
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,050
Let me help you.

484
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,202
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson.

485
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,044
You're good at playing games.

486
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,282
But this was simply
the wrong hand to play.

487
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,084
She has murdered
countless people

488
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,243
lo fulfill this... this
ridiculous fantasy.

489
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,926
History...

490
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,404
is finally coming for you.

491
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,766
What is this?

492
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,251
I don't believe you.

493
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,366
You're lying.

494
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,170
I am your father.

495
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,968
Biologically speaking, anyway.

496
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,566
I think that's you, brah.

497
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,045
The Cyber Bombings...

498
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,404
All of those people.

499
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,245
That was my fault.

500
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,404
She used me for that.

501
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,721
Your jealousy has always
blinded you

502
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,643
to Mr. Alderson's value.

503
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,246
<i>That is why you can never see
my plan through to the end.</i>

504
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,089
I have to believe

505
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,889
there was a purpose.

506
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,966
Pettiness.

507
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,648
It was a dig at me.

508
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,003
It's that small,
unfortunately.

509
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,931
You can't believe him.

510
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,441
He's... He's lying.

511
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,684
<i>Know that
I will find you</i>

512
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,250
<i>as soon as our project
is complete.</i>

513
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,970
But for the here and now...

514
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,329
our time has come...

515
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,211
lo an end.

516
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,209
No, it's not over.

517
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,209
It's not over.
It can't be.

518
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,082
She was gonna bring
my mom back.

519
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,048
We were gonna be reunited.

520
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,764
You made an offer, cuz.

521
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,970
Now it's time to pay up.

522
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,288
Please tell me
you're not bluffing.

523
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,010
What are you gonna
do to her?

524
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,360
What are you asking?

525
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,490
Retribution.

526
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,406
I want ii.

527
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,049
Coast Guard is allowing
the shipment

528
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,724
of humanitarian aid to Iran.

529
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,401
Trust me.

530
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,325
It'll work.

531
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,487
I'm afraid your
only move here...

532
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,608
Accept that
you've been conned.

533
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,129
It's downloaded.

534
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,406
Now, you know

535
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,842
I ain't got to tell you
what they going to do

536
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,571
if this don't check out right.

537
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,366
It'll checkout.

538
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,687
You know I've always had
faith in you, cuz.

539
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,365
Do your thing.

540
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,686
Find a way to live
with what you did.

541
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,211
What do we do now?

542
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,526
Undo the hack.

543
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,049
Don't think
I'm doing this for you.

544
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,241
Dom.

545
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,088
You are a terrible person.

546
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,444
Don't ever convince
yourself of anything else.

547
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,927
All you deserve
for the rest of your life...

548
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,571
is pure and utter agony.

549
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,250
That'll begin to scratch
the surface

550
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,004
of how I feel about you.

551
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,486
You've taken everything
from me.

552
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,811
My whole life...

553
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,646
is ruined because of you.

554
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,690
Live with that.

555
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,641
Die with that.

556
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,561
<i>The FBI had Romero's
keylogger files,</i>

557
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,927
<i>but he encrypted them
with a password.</i>

558
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,607
<i>Thing is, the FBI
didn't know Romero.</i>

559
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,971
<i>I do.</i>

560
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,603
<i>Is this really it?</i>

561
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,442
<i>The moment this can
all truly end?</i>

562
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,688
<i>Reverse everything we've done.</i>

563
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,840
<i>Finally bring Five/Nine
to an end.</i>

564
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,525
This is it.

565
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,640
Everything that was typed
on those machines

566
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,722
at the arcade
on the night of the hack.

567
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,811
So what'd you find?

568
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,126
He didn't do it.

569
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,928
Romero was just spying on us.

570
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,609
He caught someone else
exporting the key data.

571
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,922
If he didn't do it,
then who the fuck did?

572
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,208
Reminder,
today's city-wide curfew

573
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,169
starts at 9:00 p.m.
this evening

574
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,766
until 4:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

575
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,686
Stay indoors
and stay off the streets.

576
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,445
Why did you bring up
Kevin McCallister?

577
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,966
The snowman.

578
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,730
When we were in Coney Island,
you asked me if I remembered.

579
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,280
What was that all about?
It felt so random.

580
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,811
That was the day Dad
pushed me out the window.

581
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,881
What are you...
what do you mean...

582
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,928
Dad pushed you out the window?

583
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,850
He was mad that I told Mom
about his cancer,

584
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,169
and he pushed me
out the window.

585
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,925
You were young.

586
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,604
I guess I never told you.

587
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,808
What are you talking
about Elliot?

588
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,166
I was there.

589
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,168
We were in your room
looking for a camera

590
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,810
when Dad came home.

591
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,480
For some reason

592
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,089
you freaked out and told me
to go hide in the closet.

593
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,530
Then Dad came in the room,
and all of the sudden

594
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,770
you... I don't know.
You just snapped.

595
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,285
You started swinging
your baseball bat,

596
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,328
hitting everything.

597
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,006
No.

598
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,526
That's not what happened.

599
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,449
Trust me, I remember.

600
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,763
You took your baseball bat
and you smashed the window,

601
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,968
and then you kept telling Dad
you were gonna jump.

602
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,929
Elliot, you weren't pushed.

603
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,441
You jumped.

604
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,363
I don't remember
any of that.

605
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,403
Well, I'm here to remember
for you.

606
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,210
This is our stop.

607
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,251
I'm gonna ride the train
a little longer.

608
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,601
Are you okay?

609
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,285
I'll get it done.

610
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,324
Hey. The email from Trenton.

611
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,605
I know she sent it to you
because she could trust you.

612
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,530
The same as I always have.

613
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,329
I'm gonna get off
at the next stop.

614
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,445
I think you
should come with me.

615
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,650
It wasn't Romero.

616
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,162
It was you who exported
the keys.

617
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,371
<i>Why'?</i>

618
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,449
We're close, Elliot.

619
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,085
You pull the ripcord now

620
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,205
and everything will be
for nothing.

621
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,682
There was a huge cost
to get to this point.

622
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,960
I still believe if we hold out
a little longer...

623
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,246
No.

624
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,251
You do this,

625
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,485
and they will have won.

626
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,965
You really believe undoing
this is going to fix anything?

627
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,530
Huh? Do you?

628
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,125
I mean, who is this
really gonna help?

629
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,645
Me.

630
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,365
I'm doing this for me.

631
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,567
I can't live with
what I did anymore.

632
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,850
And you're wrong.

633
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,731
They won't win.

634
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,565
Because one good thing
came out of all of this.

635
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,809
They showed themselves,

636
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,521
the top 1% of the 1%,

637
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,004
the ones in control,

638
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,451
the ones who play God
without permission.

639
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,242
And now I'm gonna take
them down.

640
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,411
All of them.

641
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,604
Whatever happens after this,

642
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,365
I want us to keep talking.

643
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,650
I want us to be a team.

644
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,648
I know I can't force you so...

645
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,886
I'm asking.

646
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,930
'Jumped.

647
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,485
I wasn't pushed.

648
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,286
Did you know that'?

649
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,327
You asked me before
why I did this.

650
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,168
We, the damned!

651
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,170
<i>The reason is
I thought...</i>

652
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,164
What if we were wrong?

653
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,527
What if there's something
we weren't seeing?

654
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,885
What if we failed?

655
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,684
The real
reason <i>is</i> it's...

656
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,764
It's because it's what you
would've done.

657
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,205
<i>You were right.</i>

658
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,769
<i>There was a pan' of you in me.</i>

659
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,965
I never wanted
to tell you that

660
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,690
because it's not in my nature.

661
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,410
It's not why I exist.

662
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,203
Only you know why I'm here.

663
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,366
On the night of the hack,
I transferred the keys

664
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,284
from the arcade...

665
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,249
to a remote virtual machine

666
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,040
on our box at home.

667
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,042
<i>I then burned it to a CD.</i>

668
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,241
You'll find the seed data
and the algorithm

669
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,722
<i>embedded in one
of those pictures.</i>

670
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,051
You'll know the one.

671
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,889
With those two pieces, you
should be able to regenerate

672
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,050
<i>the keys that were used</i>

673
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,407
to encrypt all
of E Corp's data.

674
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,165
And with that...

675
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,440
You can make it like
Five/Nine never happened.

676
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,044
<i>This is a reminder,
today's city-wide curfew</i>

677
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,963
<i>begins at 9:00 p.m.
this evening</i>

678
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,611
<i>through 4:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.</i>

679
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,001
<i>Stay indoors
and off the streets.</i>

680
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,450
Dude, what the fuck?
Slow down.

681
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,760
<i>Fucking asshole.</i>

682
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,171
Shit.

683
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,046
Like I was saying, this shit
has been fucking rough.

684
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,961
I hear you.
It's hit everybody.

685
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,681
Yeah, the difference being
when it hits you,

686
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,964
you don't have to suck
some cuck's shrimp dick

687
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,724
to buy a damn sandwich.

688
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,805
This is true.

689
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,400
I think things are gonna
change though.

690
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,966
For the better.

691
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,960
Soon, so...

692
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,411
Hang in there.

693
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,650
Hanging's what I do best.

694
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,405
But I don't know
what you mean.

695
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,961
E Corp's in
a world of shit.

696
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,849
Daddy lost both his homes
and his bike 'cause of them.

697
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,562
And now this country's
attackin' Iran.

698
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,526
If anything, this is the calm
before the damn storm.

699
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,131
Yeah, well...

700
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,045
Hold out hope.

701
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,210
Trust me.
I think...

702
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,371
I think E Corp will be able
to bring back their lost data.

703
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,450
Yeah, well,
I hope not.

704
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,529
That just means debt's
gonna come back.

705
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,326
And I certainly don't know
how my $80,000 student loan

706
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,482
I owe Parsons is gonna
help me fix anything.

707
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,085
Well, it's a start.

708
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,011
Path to recovery.

709
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,650
The economy will start
to bounce hack.

710
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,289
Girl, you don't
have to sound so simplistic.

711
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,926
That's not the way this
crony capitalism shit works.

712
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,561
Shit, educate yourself
on some Marx

713
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,883
before you go just theorizing
about economic forces.

714
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,449
Okay, so...

715
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,801
What do you think
would fix all of this then?

716
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,771
An act of God.

717
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,285
And right about now,

718
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,043
he needs a hell
of a good blow job, just like

719
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,770
every other stressed-out,
powerful motherfucker

720
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,649
trying to hold their shit
together, right?

721
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,565
Well, this is me.

722
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,928
I'm really glad
I met you tonight.

723
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,081
Me too, babes.

724
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,165
Why you coming to this
ugly ass building anyways?

725
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,485
My brother lives here.

726
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,488
You think he'd be down
for a good time tonight?

727
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,450
Well, he definitely needs
to get laid, but...

728
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,401
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

729
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,727
Shit.
What?

730
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,081
There go them
damn eses again.

731
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,649
Fuck, and now they parking.

732
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,920
LOOK.

733
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,206
I got to go, babe.

734
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,729
Can I help you, fellas?

735
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,211
My sister,

736
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,283
only the north stars
of the cosmos

737
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,771
can help a visionary like me.

738
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,120
But, yes,

739
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,800
you can shine alight
on a dark corner of my mind.

740
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,450
What?

741
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,361
Who are you'?

742
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,521
I'm just...

743
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,370
I'm just a brave traveler

744
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,369
who's finally come home.
