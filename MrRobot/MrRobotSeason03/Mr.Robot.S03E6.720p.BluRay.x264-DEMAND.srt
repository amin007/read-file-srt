1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,889
I need you to keep
an eye on me.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,610
You're the only person
I can trust.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,207
This is what
democracy looks like!

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,248
Elliot, I'm working
with the FBI.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,361
You've been spying on me?

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,091
<i>The other
night, I followed you.</i>

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,367
<i>He snuck out and met
up with Angela.</i>

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,887
Stage 2, I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,691
<i>It's time Phillip Price's
hand got slapped.</i>

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,242
<i>This morning at 6:07 a.m.,
the Dark Army tried to run Stage 2.</i>

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,687
<i>They're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.</i>

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,889
We need to get Tyrell
before it's too late.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,524
My wife, my son, and I
will go to the Ukraine

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,728
after the plan is complete.
I'll get into that.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,007
Everybody...

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,727
This is a zero sum game.
Accept the truth.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,484
<i>The Recovery building's
going to explode,</i>

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,528
<i>and the people inside
right along with it.</i>

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,926
<i>Angela's the
one behind this.</i>

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,047
<i>I gotta stop her.</i>

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,406
I got it done.
Oh, good.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,051
Irving, are you still gonna
evacuate the Recovery center?

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,201
<i>That's been done already.</i>

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,965
I'm Emily Moss's daughter,
Angela Moss.

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,601
I'm here to discuss
the Washington Township case.

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,001
Dad, what's going on?
I'll let you two talk.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,966
<i>Twenty-six employees died from
similar types of leukemia.</i>

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,003
<i>Evil Corp killed my mom,</i>

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,323
and my whole life,
I've always wanted justice...

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,286
for her death.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,571
I think I've seen
this one, yeah.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,324
Elliot has these on VHS.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,047
Is Elliot here,
Mr. Alderson?

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,047
No, he didn't...
He didn't come.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,807
<i>Why'?</i>

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,524
Well, I guess he wasn't
feeling up to it.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,769
I don't wanna
be here, either.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,248
There's a lot
of nice people visiting.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,682
Are you sure you don't
wanna join the party?

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,646
We got this cake.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,561
Red Velvet.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,481
Not hungry.

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,001
You know, if that
were me over there,

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,331
I would want Elliot and Darlene
to come over and talk to me.

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,562
But, I don't want
to talk to her.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,881
You remember the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,088
in the first
Back to the Future movie?

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,883
Marty had to push his dad to
ask Lorraine to be his date.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,682
And if George didn't
overcome his fear,

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,803
they would never
have gotten married,

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,769
and Marty would
never have been born,

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,481
and he would've disappeared
from that photograph, right?

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,326
I guess so.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,645
I know it's scary,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,891
but I also know
that you can do it.

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,603
Just might need a little push.
That's all.

57
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,405
Hey, Angela,

58
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,245
somewhere down the road,

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,085
if Elliot needs
some help and...

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,844
I can't be there for him...

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,171
Just give him a little
push too, okay?

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,851
Okay.

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,843
You understand?
Of course, Emily.

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,765
Also, I know
we discussed it before,

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,605
but I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't bring it up again.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,121
Ifs about the anonymous
benefactor who keeps...

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,522
I'll let you two talk.
Don...

68
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,522
Sorry, did I say something
I shouldn't have?

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,722
Not at all.
You're fine.

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,601
Well, he reached out again,
offering to pay for your...

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,048
That's very nice of him,
but I've made my decision.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,726
No more treatments.

73
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,762
I wanna spend what time I have
left with my friends and family.

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,723
Just know that there's still
people fighting for you,

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,290
for your family.

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,970
We're gonna continue
with the lawsuit

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,929
and do everything
we can in your name.

78
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,441
Hey, you.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,971
Hi.

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,810
What do you
think of the party'?

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,051
This isn't fun.

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,526
It's weird.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,161
Weird how?

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,961
It's okay.
You can say it.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,082
I'm dying.
I don't want to.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
I hate this.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,764
I hate all of it.
Angela...

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,528
you know this isn't
good-bye, right?

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,046
No, I know
what dying is.

90
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,806
You're never gonna
see us again,

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,691
not Dad, not me...
No, listen,

92
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,369
lam always
gonna be there for you,

93
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,411
no matter what.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,211
You wanna know
what I believe?

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
What?

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,210
That this isn't the end,

97
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,170
that there's another world
out there for both of us,

98
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,809
that we'll
see each other again.

99
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,322
And we'll play
and dance

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,324
and bake and sing.

101
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,570
Doesn't that sound beautiful?

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,685
Will you believe with me?

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
Angela...

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,607
WOMAN ON PA;
Attention.

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,648
Is there something
you wanna tell me'?

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,404
<i>This is an emergency...</i>

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,482
I don't know what
you're talking about.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,725
I saw you.

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,891
The 23rd floor.

110
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,850
You were at
the code signing machine.

111
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,961
What did you do?

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,009
We need
to let today happen.

113
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,051
They're blowing up a building.
Yes, I know.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,050
And you're okay
with that?

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,324
How long have you been
working with Tyrell?

116
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,920
What did he tell you? None
of that matters right now.

117
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,250
This whole time... I thought
you were helping me,

118
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,211
but you've been...

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,329
You've been
manipulating me!

120
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,444
This is what you wanted.

121
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,487
After today, your
revolution succeeds.

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,006
You just need the courage
to see it through.

123
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,205
You sound like him.

124
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,365
You, you mean.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,730
I need to stop this.

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,484
Today's work,
what Whiterose is doing,

127
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,528
is going to change
everything for the better.

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,965
You met Whiterose?

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,051
What the fuck
is happening?

130
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,527
She's going to save the world,
but we need to let her.

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,045
Save the world?

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,204
Angela, whatever Whiterose
told you is a lie.

133
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,851
She's a fucking terrorist,
and if you let this happen...

134
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
Then we're going
to look back

135
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,442
and see that these
consequences were necessary...

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,808
People are going to die!
No, they're going to be fine!

137
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,320
Including your father
and my mother.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,284
What the fuck
are you talking about?

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,490
You're not making
any sense.

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,565
Angela...

141
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
Listen lo me.

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,882
Whatever you pulled off of that
machine, I need you to give it to me.

143
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,647
Now.
I can't.

144
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,250
I don't have it anymore.
Where is it?

145
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
Who did you give it to?

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,446
Tell me what you know.

147
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,727
Where are they operating from?
Where's Tyrell?

148
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,250
Where the fuck is he?

149
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,005
I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson,

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,162
but are you even allowed
to be in this building?

151
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,847
I heard you were
let go this morning.

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,204
So much depends
upon a red wheelbarrow...

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,124
<i>Glazed with rain water...</i>

154
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,525
ELLIOT AND TYRELL;
Beside the white chickens.

155
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,970
Should've put a wire on her.

156
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,691
DiPIERRO: What did you say to him?
What I had to.

157
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,961
Well, excuse me
for doubting you,

158
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,930
but you never struck me as
a country-first type of gal.

159
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,608
I don't like you very much.
Ditto.

160
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,966
What are you, six'?

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,606
It's him.

162
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,640
Pick it up.

163
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,722
Elliot, where are you?
What's going on'?

164
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,090
I texted you the address.

165
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,203
Is that where Tyrell is? Yes.

166
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,884
We need confirmation.

167
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,246
<i>Are you sure?
Positive.</i>

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,244
Get the FBI there to stop him.
You gotta do it now.

169
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,051
Make him come to us.
Find out where he's headed.

170
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,841
Where are you going? Just
take care of Tyrell.

171
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,367
Push him.
We can keep him safe.

172
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,208
Elliot, just please don't
do anything stupid, okay?

173
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,566
<i>Just come meet me...
I gotta go.</i>

174
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,721
<i>Elliot, wait.</i>

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,887
Everything I said
this morning

176
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,924
and everything I've done...

177
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,481
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

178
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,804
Call ended.
Got the location.

179
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,370
It's a restaurant
called Red Wheelbarrow.

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,771
Let's move.

181
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,170
Dom, you heard him. He said
the info was good. Let's go.

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,846
What aren't you
telling me'?

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,047
Dom...

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,204
<i>Between the rioters and the
police at E Corp's headquarters,</i>

185
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,645
<i>I can't connect there.</i>

186
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,404
<i>I can't access my
back-doored machine,</i>

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,450
<i>but I need to log in to that
UPS, or everything's fucked.</i>

188
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,760
<i>Fastest way of connecting</i>

189
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,002
<i>is to go into the
Recovery building myself.</i>

190
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,810
I heard
the conversation myself.

191
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,810
Our CHS has confirmation.

192
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,401
So she had eyes on him?
No, not exactly, but...

193
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,005
The intel
seems credible, sir.

194
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,803
We gotta act before Wellick
disappears for another five months.

195
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,845
Here's what we'll do,

196
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,323
I'll put surveillance on the location
until we have visual confirmation.

197
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,723
Surveillance? Santiago,
the lead is solid.

198
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
This is coming from Darlene.
This is why we have her.

199
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,169
I can't move
on the word of a CHS

200
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,130
who has basically, so far,
given us jack shit,

201
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,084
and then disappeared on us
for almost a week,

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,605
without so much as a word.

203
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,170
I need something
more concrete.

204
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,043
If Wellick is there, we have time.
He's not going anywhere.

205
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,887
Before we send SWAT bashing down doors,
let me coordinate with 5.0. teams

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,961
to get eyes on the place.

207
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,287
Ask the S.O. ASAC
to get aviation in the air.

208
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,091
We get confirmation, we go
in, we take down Wellick.

209
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,207
Dom...

210
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,330
We may only get
one shot at this.

211
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,925
I wanna make sure
we do it right.

212
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,441
I suppose
congratulations are in order.

213
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,610
After all our tit-for-tat, you
finally got your U.N. vote.

214
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,443
Quite the frenetic day for
the 24-hour newshounds.

215
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,931
I wondered
if you'd make it today,

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,241
given everything
going on at E Corp.

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,762
An eventful morning indeed.

218
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,884
But something told me
I shouldn't miss our little

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,446
soiree,

220
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,491
not for the world.

221
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,042
Speaking of my dear little,
wounded E Corp,

222
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,291
I'll be expecting China
to sign that economic accord.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,526
All will be done
by end of day.

224
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,960
You have my word.

225
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,204
Oh, thank God
that's settled.

226
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,570
For now, let's break from
our usual brinksmanship.

227
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,369
No need to spoil
this afternoon.

228
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,807
We both won,
<i>as</i> intended.

229
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,804
It's time to drink
and be merry.

230
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,561
Good point.

231
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,566
Another fine choice
of venue by Sergey.

232
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,165
Utterly tasteless.

233
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,164
I passed that buffoon
of an owner in the lobby.

234
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,246
You're gonna take
him up on his offer

235
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,130
to go boating tomorrow?
Oh, please, don't remind me.

236
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,324
Those swim trunks he
insists upon wearing,

237
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,604
a bit too snug...

238
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,320
And a bit too short,
wouldn't you say? Mm.

239
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,446
I believe the appropriate
term is "hanging brain."

240
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,840
Good.

241
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,321
Good.

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,646
<i>Sir, it's about Mr. Wellick.</i>

243
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,042
<i>Our contact says his location
has been compromised.</i>

244
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,244
Well, that doesn't
change anything.

245
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,891
You know what to do.

246
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,641
Km' process:

247
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,404
<i>When an unwanted process is running
and you need to terminate it.</i>

248
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,685
<i>I need to kill Stage 2
before it kills anyone else.</i>

249
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,081
Wrap it up. False alarm.
We're outta here.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,126
Back it up!
Let's go.

251
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,362
False alarm, folks.
It's safe to go back to work.

252
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,131
<i>What are they doing?
What about my bomb threat?</i>

253
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,725
False alarm. Go ahead, go up.

254
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,131
Why is everyone going back in?
Everything's fine. False alarm.

255
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,521
No, it's not safe. You gotta
get them out of there.

256
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,602
ESU swept the floor.
All's clear.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,128
Uh... It's...

258
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,323
It's safe
to go back to work.

259
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>ELLIOT; I called in a bomb threat
with no bomb for them to find.</i>

260
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,248
<i>There's no tangible explosive.</i>

261
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,002
<i>They had no idea
what they were looking for.</i>

262
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,725
Bur <i>I</i> do. MAN; Folks,
you need E Corp I.D.

263
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,485
to re-enter the building. Please
have them out where we can see them.

264
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,043
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

265
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,290
Have your badges out
and ready.

266
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,485
Let's go. One at a time.

267
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,480
<i>Can you give us a
status update on the seventh ﬂoor?</i>

268
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,167
Seventh floor clear.
Heading back down to you.

269
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,126
<i>I was right.</i>

270
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,043
<i>Angela helped them
get around my patch</i>

271
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,851
<i>and sign their own malware
with a cloned HSM.</i>

272
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,042
<i>If I can roll it back,
the clean version</i>

273
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,646
<i>will overwrite Tyrell
and Mr. Robot's malware</i>

274
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,485
<i>and buy me some time
to revoke the stolen keys.</i>

275
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,329
<i>A couple of minutes,
and we'll be...</i>

276
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
<i>Why can? I do this?</i>

277
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,924
<i>Why can 'l I
start the restore?</i>

278
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,446
Names are Fattie,
Fattina, and Georgie.

279
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,768
Georgie was named
after my aunt.

280
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,922
Lovely woman.
Fat fingers, though.

281
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,451
<i>What the
fuck is going on?</i>

282
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,530
Anyway, it's nice to have
a customer flag me down.

283
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,884
Since Five/Nine, we haven't
had a whole lot of customers.

284
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,003
Hey. Stop, stop.

285
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,811
What's the problem? You told
me Houston on Avenue A.

286
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,321
When did I say that?
Twenty seconds ago.

287
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,926
<i>Mr. Robot.</i>

288
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,365
<i>I lost time. We know that.
But how much did he take?</i>

289
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,522
<i>Fifteen minutes. I can't
spare 15 minutes.</i>

290
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,886
Stop the goddamn car.

291
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,811
Pull over now!

292
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,610
<i>If the malware's
already loaded,</i>

293
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,160
<i>hydrogen is filling up
the battery room right now.</i>

294
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,971
<i>There are too many factors to
predict when it's going to blow.</i>

295
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,209
<i>Could be two hours, or it
could explode at any second.</i>

296
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,330
<i>Why do we always out
these things so damn close?</i>

297
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,921
Agent DiPierro.

298
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,286
<i>Tell me you
have something, Dom.</i>

299
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,364
I am sitting here, fucking pins
and needles, losing my shit.

300
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,442
<i>You know I can't share
any information, Darlene.</i>

301
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,650
Have you heard anything
more from Elliot?

302
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,531
No, I've been trying to call
him, but he's not answering.

303
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,922
Unless you've got more intel that can
further this case, I'm hanging up.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,368
We gave you this lead. You
wouldn't have shit without us.

305
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,445
Don't think for a second
that I don't know

306
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,010
that you're keeping
something from me.

307
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,885
<i>Given what's at stake,</i>

308
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,124
<i>whoever you're protecting,</i>

309
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,843
<i>I sure as shit hope
they're worth it.</i>

310
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,885
Wrong fucking day,
girls.

311
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,087
You hungry?

312
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,006
Yeah, I could eat.

313
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,562
No, I mean, do you
wanna go get lunch?

314
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,848
I can get lunch
if you wanna get lunch.

315
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,046
I'd be up for it.

316
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,082
All right then, I guess
we're going to lunch.

317
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,362
I don't understand.
Why is everyone leaving'?

318
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,803
They should be
monitoring the fallout.

319
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,690
Where are Joanna
and my son?

320
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,004
What time
is our flight to Kiev?

321
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,006
What is this?

322
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,246
What's going on?

323
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,766
<i>Everything's gone.</i>

324
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,966
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

325
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,363
<i>Is Mr. Robot gaining control,
or am I losing control?</i>

326
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,364
<i>If he has the power to switch,
does that mean I do too?</i>

327
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,681
<i>Is this a matter of
who wants to win the most?</i>

328
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,529
Yeah, I agree,

329
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,290
<i>this is fucking confusing.</i>

330
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,004
Your trip to the Ukraine,

331
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,082
it's not gonna work out
the way we discussed it.

332
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,084
I've got 14 customers,

333
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,810
four cooks behind the line,
two girls working checkout.

334
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,291
No sign of Wellick.

335
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,766
We had a deal.

336
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,442
I found a solution.

337
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,522
You said you'd bring
my family to me.

338
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,806
What's going on out front? NORM:
I've got eyes on the door.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,525
Nothing unusual there
or nearby.

340
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,241
You fucking promised!

341
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,802
The plan is happening
because of me,

342
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,609
and this is how
you repay me?

343
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,405
I'm afraid the situation
is more nuanced than that.

344
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,724
<i>Shit, there it
is again, his presence.</i>

345
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,286
<i>Do you feel it too?</i>

346
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,328
<i>No, I need more time.</i>

347
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,121
<i>At least he didn't get
too far this time.</i>

348
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,927
<i>Five minutes.</i>

349
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,809
<i>I'm narrowing the gap,
but still,</i>

350
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,963
<i>this isn't one of our bullshit
stalemate prison chess games.</i>

351
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,802
<i>In this case, a stalemate
means Mr. Robot wins.</i>

352
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,570
So, this is it?

353
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,929
This is how
it's going to end'?

354
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,651
Bathrooms in use.
Make that 15 customers.

355
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,882
Follow
the instructions inside,

356
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,565
and then burn them.

357
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,490
<i>Well, unless Tyrell's taking
a leak, what do you wanna do?</i>

358
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,961
I'm gonna eat.

359
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,565
You're not going to kill me?

360
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,801
Tyrell...

361
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,321
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,491
<i>Stay focused.
Stay focused.</i>

363
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,801
<i>The stronger I am,
the better chance I have of...</i>

364
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,489
<i>Three more minutes gone. Who
knows how many I have to spare?</i>

365
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,925
<i>I'm running out of options.</i>

366
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,685
<i>Instead of fighting,
maybe it's time we talk.</i>

367
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,369
The soda fountain's
behind you there.

368
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,488
Have a seat, and we'll call
your number when it's ready.

369
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,404
Oh, and here's
our loyalty card.

370
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,689
Ten wheelbarrows punched, and
you get a free milkshake on us.

371
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,447
You know, I don't get to
this neighborhood too often.

372
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,567
How long
have you been open'?

373
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,611
A little over six weeks,
but if you're talking about

374
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,489
the grand opening special,
that's over.

375
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,726
Just curious.
Thanks, hon.

376
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,729
<i>I guess
he didn't like my note.</i>

377
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,004
<i>I need to get
to the battery room.</i>

378
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,325
Enjoy your meal, ma'am.

379
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,241
I got a worker exiting now, red apron.
Keep an eye on him.

380
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,566
NORM; 10-4.

381
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,451
Mom, it's me. Listen, I
don't have a lot of time.

382
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,564
I need you to stay home for the
rest of the day. Don't go out.

383
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,921
I'll ship you some Ensure.
Just don't go...

384
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,844
I'll have it delivered today.

385
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,766
Yes, yes, they have
same-day delivery now.

386
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,569
I promise.
Just stay home.

387
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,246
I love you too.

388
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,243
So, I'm going to move in
with my oldest daughter, Louise.

389
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,483
We agreed it's best to pool
our resources these days,

390
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,723
but... I don't
wanna be a burden.

391
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,723
Don't think like that.

392
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,451
You know it's
the best thing to do.

393
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,169
And it doesn't make sense for
you to be living all alone.

394
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,488
WOMAN 1;
You're probably right.

395
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,767
And my ulcerated colitis
is kicking in again,

396
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,604
so it'd be nice
to have family around,

397
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,967
you know,
in case anything happens.

398
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,444
WOMAN 2;
You can never be too safe.

399
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,683
Did you hear about the melee
at E Corp this morning?

400
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,764
The whole world's going
to hell in a hand basket.

401
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,649
Give me your purses, now!

402
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,765
Give it!

403
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,606
Ecoin wallet, where is it'?

404
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,649
Please, please don't hurt me!

405
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,807
Please!

406
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,769
The fuck you waiting on'?

407
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,766
Hand over your purse!

408
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,811
What's going on?
What's in there?

409
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,051
There's a fire. I've got smoke
coming from the backroom.

410
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,646
I'm looking at the floor plan
now, and there is no backroom.

411
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,164
Last time I ask, bitch!

412
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,131
Do it!

413
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,050
Cred 22958 to Op Center.
Emergency transmission.

414
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,609
<i>Go with your message, 22958.</i>

415
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,887
I've got a fire coming from
Red Wheelbarrow restaurant,

416
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,485
1197 Broadway.

417
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,927
Notify ASAC Santiago
and Five/Nine task force

418
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,401
of a possible Wellick sighting.
Copy that.

419
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,606
What are you doing?
Give him your purse!

420
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,845
Norm, I'm going in. Get
around to the backdoor now,

421
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,968
<i>in case Tyrell's in there
and tries to run.</i>

422
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,210
You could've died.

423
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
No.

424
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
No one's gonna die.

425
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,762
<i>The battery room has a
halocarbon fire suppression system.</i>

426
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,207
<i>If I can activate it,
it'll suck all the oxygen</i>

427
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,770
<i>out of the room
in 30 seconds,</i>

428
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,763
<i>seal all the doors,
and create a vacuum,</i>

429
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,208
<i>making it impossible to create any
kind of spark, which would prevent...</i>

430
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,171
<i>The kill command.</i>

431
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,931
<i>Here I am, trying to use
it to stop this attack</i>

432
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,606
<i>while Mr. Robot
is trying to use it on me.</i>

433
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,328
<i>Does that just mean
we cancel each other out,</i>

434
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,764
<i>fighting so hard,
we end up standing in place?</i>

435
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,251
<i>Fuck that.
I gotta keep moving.</i>

436
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,250
Dude, you okay?
Yeah.

437
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,729
You disobeyed a direct order.
I told you, flat out...

438
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,768
I already told you
it was a site survey.

439
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,485
Report me if you want.

440
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,928
Then why am I standing
in a goddamn basement

441
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,651
with the door kicked in?
There were signs of a fire.

442
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,366
I did my job.

443
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,642
I'd do it again,
if given the opportunity.

444
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,806
Anything else?

445
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,486
All right.

446
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,407
LOOK,

447
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,926
despite your blatant disregard
for chain of command,

448
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,764
this was still a win.

449
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,686
Wellick <i>was</i> here.

450
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,168
The evidence ERT pulls
out of this shit hole

451
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,208
can only bring us closer
to capturing him.

452
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,083
Now, we've got task force
canvassing the tunnels.

453
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,969
If Tyrell is in there,
we'll get him.

454
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,843
Why don't you head
back to the office?

455
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,525
When the evidence comes in,
you start sorting through it.

456
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,886
I can see your
big ass eye. Open up.

457
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,806
What do you want?
Open the goddamn door.

458
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,363
Small coffee, black.
You got it.

459
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,329
I'm gonna head up
to the office.

460
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,641
You gonna be okay?
I'll be up in a minute.

461
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,250
You fucked us,

462
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,527
bent us over the sink
and went to town.

463
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,410
You're not making any sense.
We're on the same side.

464
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,688
No... Fuck!

465
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,371
Come on, please! Fuck!

466
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,404
Fuck!

467
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,971
I saw you

468
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,364
manipulating my brother,

469
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,364
turning his condition
against him.

470
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,842
Taking down E Corp
was your plan. Remember?

471
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,640
Hey. Hey!

472
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,047
No! Stop the attack!

473
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,691
You have to stop the attack!
Get on the ground!

474
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,364
Get on the ground!
Listen to me,

475
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,124
you have to stop the attack!
On the ground!

476
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,769
ANGELA; You're the ones
who dragged me into this.

477
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,128
We didn't ask you to blow up a
goddamn building full of people.

478
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,969
You don't know what
you're talking about.

479
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,283
They're evacuating
the building.

480
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,011
It's gonna
happen any second.

481
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,401
Please, listen to
me, I can help you!

482
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,482
Let's go!
Go, go, go!

483
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,606
Tell me why I shouldn't
call the FBI and turn you in.

484
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,921
ANGELA; What is it that
you really want, Darlene?

485
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,362
With all their paper records
consolidated there,

486
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,404
this is going to mark
the official end of E Corp.

487
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,285
Folks, get back!
Please, stop.

488
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,521
You can lie to yourself
all you want...

489
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,004
But when you're alone at night,
this shit will haunt you.

490
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,610
Trust me on that.

491
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,564
DiPIERRO: Move, move.
You don't understand!

492
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,284
No, no, no,
listen to me,

493
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,283
you have
to stop the attack!

494
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,328
Now, I can have you
in handcuffs right now,

495
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,402
so I'm giving you
one last chance.

496
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,770
Convince me not to.

497
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,485
People are gonna die!

498
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,164
Stop the attack!

499
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,084
Go ahead and turn me in.

500
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,645
What attack?

501
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,808
I know what I'm doing is right...

502
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,881
What attack?

503
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,291
Holy shit...

504
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,406
<i>He did if.</i>

505
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,481
<i>We did if.</i>

506
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,690
<i>So what now?</i>

507
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,411
<i>Am I forever in limbo,</i>

508
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,926
<i>not knowing
which side I'm really on?</i>

509
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,569
<i>And what about Mr. Robot?</i>

510
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,690
<i>Does he now understand
that Tyrell and the Dark Army</i>

511
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,888
<i>have corrupted
his alleged revolution?</i>

512
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,683
<i>Does he have any fight left?</i>

513
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,522
<i>If so, who's he gonna fight?</i>

514
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,725
<i>Them or me?</i>

515
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,841
<i>There were no paper
records in the building,</i>

516
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,650
<i>and the Dark Army
knew that,</i>

517
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,407
<i>so why did they
try to go today?</i>

518
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,247
<i>What was
Whiterose's real plan?</i>

519
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,564
<i>Does she know
something I don't?</i>

520
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,002
<i>Does everybody know
something I don't?</i>

521
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,324
<i>WOMAN; Reports are still
coming in from across the country...</i>

522
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,331
<i>ELLIOT; I fought so hard to
protect the New York facility</i>

523
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,607
<i>that I couldn't see
the bigger picture.</i>

524
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,161
<i>It wasn't a single
point of failure.</i>

525
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,360
<i>I was.</i>

526
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,644
<i>In a series of seemingly</i>

527
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,087
<i>orchestrated strikes
across the country,</i>

528
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,323
<i>a reported 71 buildings
owned by E Corp</i>

<i>exploded or caught fire.</i>

530
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,047
<i>There has been
no official confirmation,</i>

531
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,691
<i>or even speculation,
as to what caused</i>

532
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,001
<i>the explosions
and fires to occur.</i>

533
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,003
<i>Officials with knowledge
of the attacks</i>

534
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,048
<i>have stated
that the death toll</i>

535
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,044
<i>is expected to be
well into the thousands.</i>

536
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,930
<i>Meanwhile, first responders
continue to fight fires</i>

537
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,288
<i>and sort through the rubble, with
the hope of finding survivors.</i>

<i>President Obama
