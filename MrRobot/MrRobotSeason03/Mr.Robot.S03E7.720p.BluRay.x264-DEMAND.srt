1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,408
Stay right there!
Don't you fucking move!

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,090
Why'd he surrender?
Who is your leader?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,161
Fsociety.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,526
A honeypot?
For what?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
A specific server, involved in
the last fsociety attack. CS30.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,689
You should know that nothings
gonna come from this.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,205
It's nice to
finally meet you.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,850
<i>Are you sure
he is good to go?</i>

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,081
When we spoke earlier,

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,208
he was looking at me
like we'd never met.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,850
Make sure
this doesn't happen again.

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,121
Fucking weirdo.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,730
I texted
you the address.

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,205
Is that where Tyrell is?
Yes.

15
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,681
<i>DiPIERRO: We gotta act before Wellick
disappears for another five months.</i>

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,404
<i>You said you'd bring
my family to me.</i>

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,201
It's gonna work out
the way we discussed.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,760
<i>Angela, whatever
Whiterose told you is a lie.</i>

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,569
These consequences
were necessary...

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,405
People are going to die!
No, they're going to be fine!

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,370
Listen to me.
You have to stop the attack.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,246
There's one last thing
I need in order to execute,

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,288
<i>the full force
of the Dark Army.</i>

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,089

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,210
When you see Whiterose, make
sure you say I did you good.

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,044
<i>We're gonna stay
with my buddy in Arizona.</i>

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,327
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means'?

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,448
We can potentially undo
this whole thing.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,329
Excuse me,
do you have the time?

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,290
<i>REPORTER ON TV; Reports are still
coming in from across the country...</i>

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,931

the number of targets,</i>

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,642

43

I know it may seem petty
in light of today, but...

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,684
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,608
Keep turning it over
in my mind.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,521
<i>Frasier.</i>

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,851
Now, my homie said
it's iconic and shit.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,721
Even won a record 37
Primetime Emmys, or whatever.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,565
So I started watching.

50
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,608
And I'm cool with suspending
my disbelief a little,

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,041
but this?

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,723
Am I really supposed
to believe

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,327
a baldin' white dude
from Seattle

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,289
gets to smash that much?

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,567
And it's not like he was
slaying hood rats, neither.

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,561
This nigga get more butt
than ashtrays.

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,323
Turned me off from the fucking
situation comedies altogether.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,206
Had to cleanse the palate.

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,806
And I know it only got
one Emmy nomination,

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,927
but I'll tell you,

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,007
you wanna see
a believable protagonist

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,809
doing extraordinary shit?

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,649
<i>Don't sleep
on Knight Rider, yo.</i>

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,006
<i>As of now, no one

You know, we can... We...
We can work with you.

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,810
Haven't... Haven't
enough people died already today?

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,844
My man.
My man...

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,801
Relax.

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,921
Calm down.

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,690
If I was here to take you out,

73
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,246
would've done it already.

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,044
Your roomie here serves
<i>as</i> a prime example to that.

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,844
Then what is it?
Why are you here?

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,440

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,570

78

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,961
<i>as we learn more, as we find
those responsible...</i>

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,644
You know,
it's kinda sad, actually,

81
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,730
the general lack of respect
afforded to Knight Rider.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,209
They throw fucking gold
statues at the Crane brothers,

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,482
but Michael Knight and KITT,

84
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,211
their relationship predicted

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,806
the current societal
dependence on technology,

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,484
and that was 30 years ago.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,162
Plus, anytime Mike spits game
on a chick,

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,481
I swear, I believe
every goddamn word.

89
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,166
If nothing else,

90
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,568
Knight Rider should've won
a fucking statue

91
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,130
for his dope ass theme song.

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,007
I mean, the shit
just stays with you.

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,602
Stuck in my head
right now, in fact.

94
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,725
<i>A National Terrorism

<i>At this time,

100

<i>The cause of the explosions that

<i>or worse, if any additional attacks

Elliot, it's okay.

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,642
Just calm down
and keep breathing.

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,761
Okay.
And you can tell me

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,410
what it is
that you think you did, okay'?

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,970
Just breathe,

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,402
and whenever you're ready,
we can talk.

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay.

110
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,367
Uh...

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,321
I-n-

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,087
I think we...

113
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,925
I'm... I'm sorry.

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,726
I don't know if I can say it.

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,486
I don't know if I can say it,

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,369
what... I'm sorry, Krista.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,809
What... What he...

118
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,161
Or I...

119
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,521
What... What...

120
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,448
What we both may have done,
I don't know if I can say it.

121
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,887
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,561
<i>I'm sorry,

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,165

124
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,851
<i>I can't. I'm sorry.</i>

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,122
<i>I don't know if I can say it.</i>

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,524
Nice to see you again,
beautiful.

127
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,090
Hello, Mr. Robot.

128
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,286
Of course he comes running
to you after today.

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,521
So predictable.

130
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,803
Elliot said he wanted
to speak to me, but

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,162
conscious or not, I suspect that
he thought it was more important

132
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,287
that I speak to you.

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,442
Why do you have to keep
going through a middleman?

134
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,329
Why can't he just
speak to me himself?

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,243
I'm not sure he wants to,
but I wanna help you

136
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,367
figure out why.

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,961
Elliot told me he's worried

138
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,485
that you may have done
something harmful.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,164
Do you know what
he might be referencing?

140
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
Everything that happened today

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,567
is because he was ignoring
our responsibilities.

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
What happened exactly?

143
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,691
The point is...

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,761
It's not me
he has to worry about.

145
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,651
Ifs the others,
the real string pullers.

146
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,087
Who would that be?

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,005
You wanna know
what's really going on'?

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,011
Look around, sweetheart.

149
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,284
I'm not the only one
under their thumb.

150
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,571
They're manipulating
everything, always,

151
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,690
just 10 line their own pockets,
to have total control.

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,205
But that's the conspiracy,
man.

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,566
So you and Elliot...

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,730
you want to challenge
these manipulators?

155
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,408
Me and Elliot wanted
to take the control away,

156
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,403
give it back to the ones
who were getting shit on.

157
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,046
We got halfway there,
until someone swiped my ideas

158
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,168
and warped them to suit
whatever bullshit agenda

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,651
served their self-interest.

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,490
That's what Five/Nine
was about,

161
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,250
our revolution.

162
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,722
So you are a supporter
of Five/Nine?

163
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,365
Supporter?

164
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,726
I was no supporter.

165
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,086
I was the architect!

166
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
How about telling me
why you think

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,003
Elliot might be upset
with you?

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,970
I don't have time
for this shit.

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,769
I gotta find the pricks
who screwed me.

170
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,091
Turn on the news, lady.

171
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,804
All these buildings
fucking blowing up.

172
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,325
I think they're trying
to pin that shit on me.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,084
I know it.
It ain't happening.

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,321
So, the attacks today were a
part of the revolution you created?

175
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,686
Is that what you're saying?

176
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,121
We were only supposed
to take out one location,

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,931
once all the paper records
were centralized.

178
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,605
That was it.

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,769
Yeah, I've gotta be
honest with you, Mr. Robot,

180
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,002
this sounds like
delusions of grandeur.

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,371
How else do you explain what
the authorities are saying?

182
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,847
They claim to have
the man responsible.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,481
Wellick?

184
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,051
No, he was working for me,

185
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,364
but you and the rest
of the world

186
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,408
are never gonna know that,
because you keep happily

187
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,448
lapping up those sugar-coated
pearls of semen

188
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,045
they keep pouring down
your throats.

189
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,441
You're buying the narrative

190
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,045
that they've been pushing
for months.

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,771
Pigs at a trough!

192
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,486
You still don't believe me.

193
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,486
You're indulging me right now,

194
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,289
like I'm one
of your nutso patients.

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,325
Do the math.

196
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,530
Elliot worked at Allsafe,

197
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,042
ground zero for Five/Nine.

198
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,524
He was also arrested
for hacking.

199
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,245
He even hacked you,
didn't he?

200
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,289
And he's completely
out of his mind.

201
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,966
You add all that up...

202
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,770
You still want to doubt me?

203
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,771
<i>Good people of Earth,</i>

204
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,011
<i>there is more up our sleeves.</i>

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,166
<i>Seventy-one buildings
is a parlor trick.</i>

206
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,929
<i>Our true act of sorcery
will astound</i>

207
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,566
<i>within the next 24 hours.</i>

208
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,448
<i>To all fat cats,
gluttons, and honchos,</i>

209
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,526
<i>as you lazily don
your ribbons of remembrance</i>

210
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,090
<i>for this tragic day,</i>

211
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,890
<i>do not forget,
the clock is ticking.</i>

212
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,528
I think the public
may lose faith in the Bureau,

213
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,001
once they learn
that you squandered

214
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,208
the chance to prevent
another attack.

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,566
I'm not gonna be strong-armed,

216
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,483
not by you,
not after today.

217
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,965
Then I suggest
you start taking

218
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,530
my client's words seriously.

219
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,641
DiPIERRO: This is unreal.

220
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,968
The country's under attack,
and you're protecting him?

221
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,930
Wellick was targeted,

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,970
because of his access
and credentials at E Corp.

223
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,123
These terrorists threatened
his wife and son

224
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,531
if he didn't comply.

225
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,801
For five straight months,

226
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,326
my client was held captive
in a basement.

227
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,731
You can't expect us
to buy this.

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,086
We have confirmation.

229
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,725
Wellick gave
an unauthorized order

230
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,007
to put server CS30
back on the network,

231
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,930
the same night
the hack was initiated,

232
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,724
all while being
investigated for murder.

233
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,245
Yeah, a charge
for which he's been cleared.

234
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,481
DiPIERRO: That doesn't change
the facts.

235
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,569
Wellick got passed over
for CTO,

236
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,642
got fired, two days later,
disappears,

237
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,121
and now, hours before
the largest terror attack ever

238
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,249
on U.S. soil, Wellick resurfaces,
claiming he was kidnapped.

239
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,170
So, what,
are you charging my client

240
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,163
with coincidental resurfacing?

241
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,931
We don't call that coincidence
around here.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,081
We call it bullshit. Dom...

243
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,367
We have motive.
Yeah, with no hard evidence.

244
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,844
But here's what you do have.

245
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,288
You have a guy
that'll point you

246
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,362
to the terrorists
who held him hostage,

247
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,769
the actual people
behind the attacks,

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,368
the same ones planning
more destruction.

249
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,363
Mr. Wellick can ID them,

250
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,284
and tell you
their likely location,

251
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,761
in exchange for protection
and immunity.

252
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,006
We're not gonna cut a deal.

253
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,560
We're gonna charge him and just add
obstruction of justice on top of it.

254
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,641
You saw the video.

255
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,121
Time is not a luxury
that you have,

256
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,204
not with another attack
on the horizon, so...

257
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,850
do you really wanna sit here

258
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,491
and continue to quibble
about Mr. Wellick?

259
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,721
DiPIERRO: Let's just
round them all up,

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,401
Darlene, Elliot, Angela Moss.

261
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,482
Let's just haul 'em all
in here and go at 'em hard.

262
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,846
Wellick's lawyer
is right.

263
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,445
Time is not
our friend here.

264
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,204
And if Tyrell can get us
two workable leads...

265
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,327
We're being played!

266
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,160
How do you not see this?

267
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,124
I still think
the Dark Army's involved,

268
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,924
and bringing in the others
might expose that.

269
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,326
I have to brief Carney,

270
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,004
and he has to brief
the President.

271
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,204
I won't go to them with
half-assed theories again,

272
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,520
not when this much
is on the line.

273
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,125
Why do you keep ignoring
our credible sources?

274
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,487
The most credible one
being in that room.

275
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,531
Tyrell Wellick's
name alone

276
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,329
is going to play better
with them than the others.

277
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,447
Play better?

278
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,922
Are you already wondering
how this is gonna look?

279
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,129
You wanna cover this up
to the FBI Director

280
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,770
and the President
of the United States?

281
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,171
Spare me
the conspiracy theories.

282
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,651
I need to bring them
something concrete.

283
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,721
And if Wellick's lying?

284
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,649
Then this deal is off,
and we have our guy.

285
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,046
It's a win-win for us,
either way.

286
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,360
Why are you fighting
with me on this?

287
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,930
Because somethings
not adding up.

288
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,445
What's that
supposed to mean'?

289
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,568
I don't know if this is
because you're overworked

290
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,688
or stressed out
or just under some delusion

291
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,411
that you're a fucking
super-cop, but it stops now.

292
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,960
You report to me.

293
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,810
Start remembering that.

294
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,811
<i>As to what caused
the explosions and fires to...</i>

295
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,962
<i>Tyrell Wellick
and took him into custody...</i>

296
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,164
<i>Warned of another attack
within the next 24 hours.</i>

297
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,084
<i>Of our company's
paper rec...</i>

298
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,049
<i>Officials with
knowledge of the attacks</i>

299
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,849
<i>have stated
that the death toll</i>

300
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,644
<i>is expected to be well...</i>

301
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,007
Right now,
the estimate's around 3,000.

302
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,001
What estimate?

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,801
The dead.

304
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,526
But it's still climbing.

305
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,649
Okay, maybe you should just
chill with the TV for a second.

306
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,244
They're gonna be okay, right?

307
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,721
Who's that?

308
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,644
All those people who died.

309
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,209
Do you think
that they're gonna be okay'?

310
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,565
I'm gonna go grab my shit
and come back.

311
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,487
It won't be long.

312
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,126
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

313
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,960
<i>Can we just take a break?
I, I might need a minute.</i>

314
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,885
Unfortunately,
that's not possible.

315
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,244
As you know,
this is time-sensitive.

316
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,641
Okay.

317
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,842
But after this,
I get to see my family, yes'?

318
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,049
It's very important
that I see my wife and child.

319
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,767
I'll be sure to relay
your request to my superior.

320
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,366
For now, though,
need your eyes on that book.

321
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,611
<i>You shouldn't have
told anyone, Mom.</i>

322
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,091
I could get in trouble
for telling you.

323
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,444
Well, you can't be afraid
to leave the house.

324
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,124
You still have
two treatments left.

325
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,482
Don't listen to that video.
It's just a scare tactic.

326
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,561
We caught the guy.

327
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,645
Fine, fine...

328
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,046
I'll call Dr. Zeigler,
and ask if it can wait.

329
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,207
I love you too.

330
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,329
<i>REPORTER; The operation took place
at Red Wheelbarrow Barbecue,</i>

331
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,765
<i>it's a popular
fast food restaurant</i>

332
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,649
<i>in Manhattan's Flatiron
District.</i>

333
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,050
Wellick ID'd
the two suspects,

334
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,285
both corroborated
by Sasan Nouri,

335
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,600
our fsociety video perp.

336
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,487
You call it in?

337
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,800
We're about to release
a BOLO.

338
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,321
Nice work, Stanchek.

339
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,645
I'll see you down
in the squad room.

340
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,807
Okay.

341
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,130
And, sir?
What?

342
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,921
It's Wellick.

343
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,005
He keeps asking
about his family.

344
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,761
He wants to see 'em.

345
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,001
It's just us now.

346
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,846
We can speak freely.

347
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,365
You need to get anything
off your chest?

348
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,691
Well,

349
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,681
there's some information

350
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,730
that's about to be declassified
for public release,

351
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,484
and before you hear it
from your lawyer

352
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,289
or somebody else,

353
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,045
I wanted to personally come
here and deliver it to you.

354
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,568
Rumor has it you're asking
about your family?

355
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,330
Yes, I've been told,
if I cooperate...

356
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,521
Your wife's dead.

357
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,680
Almost two weeks now.

358
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,881
What?

359
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,362
No, you must be mistaken.
Lovers' quarrel

360
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,209
with a dude she was banging.

361
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,643
He shot her in the head
at close range.

362
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,966
It's nasty stuff.

363
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,569
Lies. You're lying.

364
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,643
Which means that your son

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,768
is currently being raised
at Peaceful Acres Foster Care.

366
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,324
Now, last I checked, it was
only a one in five abuse rate.

367
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,241
Decent odds.

368
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,081
No.

369
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,841
No.

370
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,205
This can't be true.

371
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,767
I know you're lying.

372
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,001
I want to see my wife.
I demand it.

373
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,929
If you're thinking about
telling anyone here about me,

374
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,521
if you veer
from the plan at all,

375
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,644
I promise, you won't live

376
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,484
to place a flower
at your wife's grave.

377
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,123
And your son...

378
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,685
I'll make it
my personal mission

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,962
to ensure he becomes
a statistic.

380
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,604
Just another forgotten child,
lost to the system, forever.

381
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,846
I know what this is. You
sent that email to the FBI.

382
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,285
I knew the Dark Army
would find out.

383
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,328
I'm not stupid.
I never sent the email.

384
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,562
How do you explain this?
Why are we here?

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,162
Kay, maybe he's not gonna
kill us, but someone sure is.

386
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,651
If anything
does happen to us,

387
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,410
if I don't make it
back to my computer,

388
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,602
I sent the email to go out
automatically

389
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,486
to someone I trust.

390
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,041
I'm supposed to be
on a J-Date with Juanita

391
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,761
at Ruby Tuesdays, as we speak.

392
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,841
She's probably
worried about me.

393
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,728
Hey. Hey, maybe...
Maybe she'll call the cops,

394
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,525
report me missing.
Doubt it.

395
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,724
Besides, what are you even
doing on J-Date?

396
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
You're not even Jewish.

397
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,805
And doesn't sound
like she is, either.

398
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,850
I told you, my 23andMe said
I'm 6% Ashkenazi,

399
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,921
and for your information,

400
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,490
her full name is
Juanita Rosenberg.

401
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,166
Look, do you think I wanna be
stuck in the backseat

402
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,163
of a psychopath's Cadillac
with you?

403
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,849
I should be at home
with my family.

404
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,162
My brother is probably
flipping out right now.

405
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,605
You think your brother's
flipping out?

406
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,603
That guy

407
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,091
slit my friend's throat,

408
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,766
and now he's digging

409
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,729
what could be a mass grave
over there.

410
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,331
Yeah. If your brother's
flipping out,

411
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,004
I'm like a Sam Kinison
stand-up bit,

412
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,969
okay, Shelley Duvall
at the Overlook Hotel.

413
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,491
I'm at "hot mic'd
Christian Bale"

414
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,210
levels of intensity
and hysteria,

415
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,442
so please, don't talk to me
about flipping out.

416
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,643
Yes. Yes.

417
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,641
What... Hang on,
what are you doing'?

418
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,926
You gotta get us out of here.
I can't...

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,401
I don't know how to drive.
You have a genius level IQ,

420
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,329
and you can't work
an automatic transmission?

421
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,004
I grew up in the city.
I never had to learn.

422
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,923
Oh, yeah, well,
you do now, kay?

423
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,490
Get up there,
put pedal to the metal.

424
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,049
Yeah, okay, okay. Okay.

425
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,046
Floor it. Floor it.

426
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,167
Okay.
Floor it!

427
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,330
Floor <i>m</i>

428
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

429
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,927
Easy! Easy!

430
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,481
Damn.

431
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,084
That's no way
to treat a Caddie.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
I can't just do nothing.

433
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,006
I almost went straight
to the authorities.

434
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,930
Oh, well, let's thank our lucky
stars you opted to call me first.

435
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,611
I told you what he said.
How can I not report this?

436
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,445
As your counsel
and your friend,

437
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,728
I should remind you,
you are bound

438
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,285
by doctor-patient privilege,

439
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,609
so unless he's stated intent
to do something in the future,

440
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,241
you can't turn him in.

441
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,927
Per HIPPA, you'll lose
your license and practice.

442
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,608
No, there's something
about this. I can feel it.

443
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,887
I know him.

444
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,442
I actually think
he might've been involved.

445
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,530
You know how many
crazies are out there

446
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,887
claiming responsibility
for the attacks?

447
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,648
The... The FBI and the police
are inundated by phone calls

448
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,449
from people
just like your client.

449
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,761
Fuck.

450
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,006
Any Updates?

451
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,402
They think the total
will be over 4,000.

452
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,089
But the number doesn't
really matter now...

453
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,001
Even if there's more.

454
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,563
What do you mean
“even if there's more"?

455
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,209
No matter what happens now,

456
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,165
everything will be fine.

457
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,804
Angela,
if there are more attacks,

458
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,166
you have to tell me.

459
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,689
I don't know
anything about them.

460
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,247
What are you doing?

461
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,841
Here, let me show you.

462
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,881
Okay. Watch.

463
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,521
See?

464
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,280
They all came back.

465
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,526
They're all fine.

466
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,125
Here, I'll show you again.

467
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,641
Told you.

468
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,931
Everyone's okay again.

469
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,051
Everyone's gonna be okay.

470
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,445
Everyone's gonna be okay.

471
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,568
<i>Our FBI reporters

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,520
<i>that the team of fsociety
members behind Five/Nine</i>

476
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,887
<i>were operating
out of the barbecue eatery.</i>

477
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,762
<i>Interestingly enough,
the basement Itself</i>

478
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,366
<i>does not appear on any plans
or blueprints</i>

479
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,046
<i>reported with the city,
so ii is possible</i>

480
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,407
<i>that Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety were operating</i>

481
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,608
<i>unbeknownst to the Red
Wheelbarrow Barbecue.</i>

482
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,207
<i>While unsuspecting employees
are not a risk</i>

483
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,961
<i>to unwitting customers, justified
the notorious hacker claim.</i>

484
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,207
Hey.

485
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,121
Hey!

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,968
Stage 2 was my operation.

487
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,610
You assholes went rogue...

488
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,970
As everyone
in this room knows well,

489
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,721
nothing creates profit
quite like global conflict.

490
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,881
Bullshit.

491
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,681
Ah, Phillip.

492
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,966
Always a pleasure,

493
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,531
though I am surprised
to see you

494
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,726
with all you have
on your plate.

495
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,529
You know damn well
I'm marooned here.

496
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,285
Well, then
a little bit of good news

497
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,725
on an otherwise trying day.

498
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,963
My government did finally

499
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,804
get around to signing
that accord.

500
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,010
Ecoin is poised to become
the world standard.

501
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,649
After your latest outburst,
nothing could save my company.

502
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,202
My actions were never meant
to harm E Corp.

503
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,721
On the contrary,

504
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,769
good old-fashioned
American sympathy

505
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,811
will go a long way in boosting
an already surging Ecoin.

506
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,244
E Corp is the very definition
of too big to fail.

507
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,884
Trust me' it will survive.

508
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,971
But, I won't.

509
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,641
So...

510
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,088
Is that... Is that what
all this has been then?

511
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,167
No.

512
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,449
When... When you
surprised me with Five/Nine,

513
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,891
I understood your move.

514
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,683
A false flag operation,
a temporary global crisis

515
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,569
to help me pressure
the administration

516
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,449
into giving you
your damn Congo.

517
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,929
All went according to plan,

518
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,526
which leaves me struggling

519
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,963
to find the upside to this.

520
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,285
Why come after me?

521
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,887
Think back
on that fateful night.

522
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,041
<i>We sat,</i>

523
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,048
listening to a young woman
playing a lyre.

524
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,010
A lawsuit was brewing
against my plant.

525
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,442
You told me you would...

526
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,931
Handle that person

527
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,485
as we usually do.

528
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,281
And yet,

529
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,803
your pet project,
Angela Moss,

530
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,440
was allowed to continue
with her lawsuit,

531
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,609
which put my plans
in jeopardy.

532
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,125
Your job was simple.

533
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,006
Manipulate her, control her.

534
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,527
You couldn't,

535
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,086
<i>so I had to.</i>

536
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,367
You little piece of shit.

537
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,006
Do not forget,

538
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,684
I installed you as CEO

539
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,128
only to protect my plant.

540
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,964
You were meant to do what
your predecessor couldn't,

541
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,169
and look at what happened
to him.

542
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,368
And now, you will follow
every order that I give you,

543
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,727
including hiring
your own replacement.

544
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,441
Fuck you.
In the interim,

545
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,366
I trust that there will be
no interference,

546
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,602
with my plant being relocated
to the Congo.

547
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,286
This... This is funny.

548
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,885
That's... That's...
That's all this is.

549
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,440
This is... This is, uh...
This is a joke

550
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,168
with a bad punchline.

551
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,004
You will also be called upon
to handle

552
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,889
all logistical issues,

553
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,203
proper access for my staff,
shipment of all materials...

554
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,250
No! You give me
the real reason, motherfucker.

555
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,011
Coming at me now.

556
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,724
What in God's name
do you hope to gain?

557
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,251
The opportunity
to teach a lesson.

558
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,324
A lesson?
You sadistic fuck.

559
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,720
You got your U.N. vote,
you got your plant,

560
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,928
you got everything you wanted!

561
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,489
No. You don't get off
that easy,

562
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,242
not until
you explain it to me.

563
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,965
You had to destroy so much.

564
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,681
<i>Why'?</i>

565
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,686
Because, Phillip...

566
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,242
I had to ask you twice.

567
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,325
What if we're being
recruited?

568
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,964
Recruited into digging
our own grave?

569
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,126
Look at the dimensions.

570
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,330
This hole's only big enough
for your friend.

571
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,726
What if were being recruited
into the Dark Army?

572
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,724
They could've...
They could've just asked.

573
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,490
They're probably planning
a follow-up attack,

574
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,244
and they need to use us
for our skills.

575
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,725
You know I can
hear you, right?

576
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,970
Even from way back here.

577
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,641
Every word.

578
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,001
Come on, man.

579
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,086
At least tell us what the
Dark Army wants from us.

580
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,685
Tell us what's going on,
or we stop digging!

581
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,327
We're serious.

582
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,966
I kinda like you two.

583
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,320
You guys are funny,
in a George-Elaine kinda way.

584
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,726
Still wouldn't try me, though.

585
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,124
I got a job to do, and

586
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,084
you don't wanna know
where this knife been.

587
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,647
You feel me?

588
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,367
Get out of the car.

589
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,889
Hurry up. I'm running
out of time here.

590
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,967
See that up there?

591
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,081
What is this?

592
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,481
You know why those people are
enjoying themselves so much,

593
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,562
even though
thousands died today

594
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,007
in the biggest attack
in U.S. history?

595
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,322
That wasn't my fault. That
wasn't supposed to happen.

596
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,565
I wanna know
who made that call.

597
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,086
Was it Tyrell?
What about this other attack?

598
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,208
That was never
a part of my plan.

599
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,286
See, kid, that's been
your mistake the entire time,

600
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,285
thinking this whole thing's
about your silly little plan.

601
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,085
No, your revolution
was only allowed lo happen

602
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,283
'cause it was bought
and paid for

603
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,885
by people like them.

604
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,767
Face it,

605
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,890
no matter how hard you try,

606
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,446
that's always the end result.

607
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,681
What the hell?

608
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,327
You're going in?

609
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,487
Mistress of a senator
we got on the payroll.

610
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,889
Powdered her nose
with some bad shit,

611
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,964
died a couple hours ago. I'm just
here to make it scandal-free.

612
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,801
You see what I mean?

613
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,645
Literally nothing
can stop these shindigs,

614
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,687
not thousands dead
across the country,

615
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,568
not a lifeless mistress
in the guest bathroom.

616
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,088
I guess they got here
sooner than I thought.

617
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,683
Worm-catching motherfuckers,
you know?

618
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,207
What's going on?

619
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,127
Who are these people?

620
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,010
This is where we say
our good-byes.

621
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,529
What?
You're leaving us with them'?

622
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,284
As you know, I'm...
I'm only a chaperone here.

623
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,162
Well, what happens now
to us?

624
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,400
Well, that will be
up to him.

625
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,844
And I got my fingers crossed
he treats you guys all right.

626
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,721
Mr. Markesh,

627
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,041
<i>Ms. Biswas,</i>

628
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,722
please follow me
into the garage.

629
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,441
What is this?

630
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,327
Take a seat.

631
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,481
PRESS.

632
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,247
Now,

633
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,121
tell me what you see.

634
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,165
<i>Location confirmed.
We're in position.</i>

635
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,129
<i>Repeat. Location confirmed.
We're in position.</i>

636
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,211
<i>Be safe out there, boys.</i>

637
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,921
<i>Keep your head on a swivel.</i>

638
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,882
<i>Alpha team approaching the door.
Taking position.</i>

639
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,321
<i>Stand by for breach.</i>

640
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,805
Assault force
is on the white side,

641
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,041
ready for primary breach.

642
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,324
A threat analysis

643
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,881
for the FAA's next-gen
lP-based system.

644
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,681
Targeting IPs in Chicago,

645
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,601
Atlanta,

646
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,887
L.A.

647
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,009
Bravo team set.
Holding perimeter.

648
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,126
This is malware

649
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,043
that targets
air-traffic control systems

650
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,045
at major airports.

651
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,530
They're planning
another attack,

652
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,051
probably like today, except

653
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,044
this time,
they're crashing planes.

654
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,760
<i>Copy, Bravo. Got Alpha
and Bravo teams in position.</i>

655
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,844
But the exploits
already written.

656
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,046
What do you need us for?

657
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,851
<i>Execute,
execute, execute!</i>

658
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,921
Go. Let's go.

659
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,324
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

660
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,002
<i>Alpha team is in.
Repeat Alpha team is in.</i>

661
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
In the Dark Army,

662
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,488
we understand what it's like
to believe in something.

663
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,801
We're willing to die
for our cause,

664
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,730
without thinking twice,

665
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,450
because we know

666
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,763
we are all soldiers
of something much larger.

667
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,285
Please don't kill us.

668
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,286
Please don't do this.

669
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,807
Room's clear.

670
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,205
<i>Bravo team, stand by.</i>

671
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,488
Something else
we all believe in,

672
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,330
self-sacrifice,

673
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,726
because when you serve
a higher power,

674
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,449
no act is more honorable
than suicide.

675
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,003
There is no greater gift

676
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,601
one can offer the cause...

677
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,125
Than everything.

678
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,440
<i>Secure garage, Alpha One.</i>

679
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,929
We can do whatever you want.

680
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,561
Please.
Maybe you can use us.

681
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,171
Everything in this room,

682
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,604
from the plans
to crash the airplanes

683
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,170
to your very presence,

684
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,208
is only here to tell a story.

685
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,130
Sadly, we have
no use for your skills,

686
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,530
but you both do serve

687
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,684
a very important purpose.

688
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,403
No. Oh, no, no, no...
No...

689
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,641
No, no, no, don't give me
the gun! No, please don't!

690
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,165
No! Stop!
No, please don't!

691
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,601
No! Stop!

692
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,045
Please don't!
No!

693
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,121
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to...

694
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,922
Let's go. Go!

695
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,491
We got a camera,
a few terminals...

696
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,406
<i>We got a body.</i>

697
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,809
<i>We have a body here.
Body?</i>

698
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,126
ALPHA 11 Oh, my God.

699
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,607
<i>Two bodies.</i>

700
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,406
Hold on.

701
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,562
<i>Got a thermal.
Find a light source?</i>

702
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,447
One male civilian DOA
on the ground with a handgun.

703
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,046
One female civilian DOA
with a second handgun.

704
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,281
<i>Room is clear.</i>

705
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,527
<i>TOC, be advised,
both jackpots are down.</i>

706
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,247
<i>Send in medics.</i>

707
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,763
<i>Alpha team to TOC,
area's secure.</i>

708
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,640
<i>We think it might
be Iranian.</i>

709
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,324
<i>Alert case squad and ERT.</i>

710
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,120
<i>Got an Iranian flag.</i>

711
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,485
<i>Fsociety masks.</i>

712
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,207
<i>Paraphernalia.</i>

713
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,367
<i>Camcorder.</i>

714
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,728
<i>Like a makeshift studio.</i>

715
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,921
It's over, DiPierro.

716
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,961
I know we would've preferred
to have gotten them alive,

717
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,282
but at least we prevented
another attack.

718
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,484
You're actually gonna
get away with this.
