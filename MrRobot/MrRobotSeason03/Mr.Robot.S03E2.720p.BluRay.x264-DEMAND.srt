1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,606
Hello?
Bonsoir, Elliot.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,166
They're planning something.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,844
<i>17 of 71 facilities
around the country so far.</i>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,524
<i>This is where the
paper records are going.</i>

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,523
Elliot, what
is Stage 2'?

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,604
<i>The femtocell was to
get access to their UPS's.</i>

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,286
<i>They're trying to blow up Evil
Corp's recovery buifdfn g.</i>

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,448
I don't play fair.
I play what I want.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,966
I invoke my Fifth Amendment.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,121
You're an
enemy combatant.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,202
You don't
have any rights.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,611
One of your
patients hacked me.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,444
He stole my dog
on top of it.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,170
The phone call...
make me understand.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,561
I wanted you
to feel what I felt.

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,649
You pussy.
You...

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,082
<i>This fucker thinks
he can hurt my girl!</i>

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,009
If you're serious about
punishing him... I am.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,923
Just tell me what to do.
The E Corp party.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,809
<i>When you saw Scott,
he was disheveled.</i>

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,247
Yeah, but Joanna...
Tell the cops your story.

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,761
Scott Knowles intimidated you.
This is how we punish him.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,444
<i>That ever-looming
presence</i>

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,727
<i>that is Mr. Robot,
I don't feel it.</i>

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,968
<i>Is it possible that the
bullet killed him...</i>

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,971
<i>And not me?</i>

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,129
I need to find a way
to fix what I did.

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,441
I need a job at Evil Corp.

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,731
<i>You know when
you fuck something up</i>

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,848
<i>and you wish you had the
power to hit "undo"?</i>

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,083
<i>Like when you say the dumbest thing
in front of your biggest crush.</i>

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,771
<i>or when you talk shit
about your boss in an email,</i>

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,888
<i>then hit "reply all"
to everyone at work.</i>

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,211
<i>Or when you crash
the entire world economy</i>

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,601
<i>and kick-start
the inevitable downfall</i>

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,330
<i>of human civilization?</i>

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,729
<i>We all have those days.</i>

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,648
<i>But today is not
gonna be one of them.</i>

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,086
<i>Because today</i>

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,284
<i>I found a way
to hit "undo."</i>

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,366
<i>Today is the day I start
working at Evil Corp.</i>

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,882
<i>Hello. I'm Linda,</i>

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,884
<i>Chief Human Resources Officer
here at Evil Corp.</i>

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,725
<i>Evil Corp is,
well, evil.</i>

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,320
<i>That much I thought, but
what I didn't realize was</i>

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,323
<i>maybe they're
a necessary evil</i>

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,368
<i>that just needs
to be kept in check.</i>

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,647
<i>In fact, maybe
calling them evil</i>

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,451
<i>was just my dorm room
philosophizing run amuck.</i>

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,490
<i>I'd like to say welcome
to the Evil Corp family.</i>

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,846
<i>We're happy
to have you here.</i>

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,803
<i>But this doesn't mean
I'm selling out.</i>

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,480
<i>I'm just growing HP-</i>

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,449
<i>Signing up for a 401K,</i>

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,490
<i>choosing an HMO plan
with a good deductible.</i>

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,006
<i>Sign up for Trunk Club.</i>

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,405
<i>Pop a few Zoloft.</i>

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,729
<i>Join in on the
live-action cartoon</i>

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,610
<i>of 2D emotions that
everyone else is in.</i>

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,809
<i>I finally see the fatal
exception error of my ways,</i>

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,645
<i>and I know what to do now.</i>

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,449
<i>I'm gonna fix
the world I broke,</i>

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,966
<i>and put it back together
better than it was before.</i>

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,249
<i>Let's talk about your crucial
role here at Evil Corp.</i>

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,522
<i>I'm gonna
undo the hack.</i>

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,365
<i>Now, I can't decrypt
the data I fucked up,</i>

67
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>that much is true.</i>

68
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,682
<i>But since I'm working
on the recovery team,</i>

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,524
<i>I can help them
rebuild the database</i>

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,523
<i>and defend the fort
at the same time.</i>

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,687
There's a little talent
roaming around on this floor,

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,565
but the primo poon
is on floor 31.

73
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>As of last week, it
looks like Tyrell was right.</i>

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,402
<i>Evil Corp has delivered
their paper records</i>

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,565
<i>from 17 of their 71 buildings
to their New York facility.</i>

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,564
Pretty sure she would cheat
on her fiance for me, man.

77
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,246
She really, like, the way she
looks at me, dude, it's like,

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,770
slippery when wet,
am I right?

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,844
<i>But lucky for
them, now they've got me.</i>

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,440
Our current plan is deeply flawed
and massively inefficient.

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,760
<i>This is William.</i>

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,763
<i>He's my technology manager.</i>

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,451
<i>If I can convince him
to convince his boss</i>

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,807
<i>to convince his boss
to convince her boss</i>

85
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,202
<i>to digitize all the paper records
in their local facilities</i>

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,362
<i>instead of shipping
them here, then...</i>

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,602
We can avoid a single
point of failure.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,205
We would install
hardware and softw...

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,805
Elliot, I hear
your passion,

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,769
but I got tickets to the Goo
Goo Dolls reunion concert

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,411
tonight, so let's wrap this up.
Okay?

92
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,331
<i>His password was
pretty easy to figure out.</i>

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,762
<i>After going
through his emails,</i>

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,081
<i>I quickly learned that
he was having the engineers</i>

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,010
<i>install rootkits on
all of Evil Corp's phones,</i>

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,169
<i>so they can illegally sell
private consumer data.</i>

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,523
<i>I tipped off the FBI,</i>

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,961
<i>got him arrested, and
promptly set a meeting</i>

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,042
<i>with the next exec
up the chain.</i>

100
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,287
<i>But meetings can take
forever to set.</i>

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,806
<i>So in the meantime, I had
to look for a stopgap.</i>

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,720
<i>In this case, E Shipping, their
shipping management console.</i>

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,527
Wait a minute,
this ain't right.

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,967
All our shipments are
supposed to go to New York.

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,403
The paper says “Sioux
Falls, South Dakota."

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,404
Yeah, you're in
Sioux Falls, Earl,

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,400
which sure as shit
don't make no sense.

108
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,209
But all right.
Unpack her, boys!

109
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,520
<i>I'm sending
shipping requests</i>

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,409
<i>to the actual facilities,</i>

111
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,482
<i>but in the manifest,
I'm making it look like</i>

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,688
<i>all the paper's still
arriving in New York.</i>

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,007
<i>It'll take a while, but I
just need to buy enough time</i>

114
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,765
<i>until I can prove my case
to upper management.</i>

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,246
By eliminating physical
paper delivery,

116
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,086
we can cut E Shipping cost, installing
hardware and software at...

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,806
Elliot, you are ambitious,
I'll give you that,

118
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,611
but I got a SoulCycle
class I'm late for.

119
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,883
Let's pick this up
sometime next quarter?

120
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,001
<i>Hacking Peter was
as easy as watching him.</i>

121
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,409
<i>I felt bad
taking him down,</i>

122
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,767
<i>until I saw that he had
his engineering team</i>

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,087
<i>use special software
to help E Cam's</i>

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,448
<i>auto manufacturing partners
cheat the emissions test</i>

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,126
<i>to hide how much pollution
they really created.</i>

126
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,287
<i>Factoring in the
bureaucracy and the line of</i>

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,841
<i>corrupt, moronic managers
I have to get through,</i>

128
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,203
<i>I'll need lo keep up the illusion
that shipments are still happening.</i>

129
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,124
These are the same damn
boxes you brought last week.

130
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,403
You know me. I do
what the paper says.

131
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,483
All right!
Pack it up, boys!

132
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,689
<i>Problem with my illusion is,
what if Tyrell and the Dark Army</i>

133
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,683
<i>think all the records
actually get there?</i>

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,570
<i>This is why I gotta keep
the UPS systems safe too,</i>

135
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,484
<i>because these innocuous
backup batteries</i>

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,005
<i>in the New York facility</i>

137
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,890
<i>can turn into idle bombs
with the right malware.</i>

138
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,008
<i>And these are
the frontline soldiers</i>

139
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,366
<i>trusted to protect them.</i>

140
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,086
You guys gonna stop me?
I'm a bloodhound, girl.

141
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,083
I just dove right back
in, dude, just... Ah.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,084
<i>This patch ensures
that the UPS devices</i>

143
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,245
<i>will only run trusted code that's
digitally signed by Evil Corp.</i>

144
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,006
<i>Bottom line, even if they think
all the paper records got here,</i>

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,162
<i>they won't be able
to blow up that building.</i>

146
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,125
In conclusion,
digitizing locally

147
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,123
and not shipping
paper records here,

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,124
is the best option for
our recovery efforts.

149
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,921
Perfect.

150
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,721
Let's set a meeting with
the VP of Technology.

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,609
I want to get this
in front of him.

152
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,650
Great work, Elliot.

153
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,569
<i>Once upper
management's on board,</i>

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,087
<i>we'll be on our way
to rebuilding the database</i>

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,561
<i>and the hack will
officially be behind us.</i>

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,401
<i>Doesn't mean that
in my spare time I can't</i>

157
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,404
<i>find ways to purge Evil
Corp of all their shitbags.</i>

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,969
<i>You know, your typical
subprime mortgage scammers,</i>

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,327
<i>Ponzi schemers...
Pension embezzlers,</i>

160
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,811
<i>and sexual harassers.</i>

161
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,611
<i>That way, when Evil Corp
gets back on its feet,</i>

162
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,841
<i>they'll no longer be evil.</i>

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,003
<i>We're proud to call you
a new member of Evil... E Corp.</i>

164
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,448
<i>Because changing the world
was never about tearing E Corp down.</i>

165
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,443
<i>It's about
making them better.</i>

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,565
<i>Maybe I fucked up an
already fucked-up world,</i>

167
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,121
<i>but I'm fixing it now,
hitting “undo. “</i>

168
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,402
<i>And, friend,
it feels great.</i>

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,131
<i>Okay,
if I'm being real,</i>

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,803
<i>I haven't
fixed everything.</i>

171
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,009
<i>The loneliness
came back.</i>

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,644
<i>Worse than I remember.</i>

173
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,611
<i>I don't get it.</i>

174
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,401
<i>I know I'm doing
the right thing.</i>

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,806
<i>You have to see that.</i>

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,923
<i>Then what is this?</i>

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,446
<i>Why do I feel this
empty void inside?</i>

178
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,688
<i>Even Zoloft
isn't helping.</i>

179
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,891
<i>I don't know
what to do.</i>

180
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,045
<i>Fuck.</i>

181
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,851
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

182
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,168
<i>I'm really starting to lose it.</i>

183
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,410
With everything going on,
my landlord at the office

184
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,211
hasn't been paying utilities
or maintenance, so...

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,401
I'll be working from my
home office for a while.

186
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,802
<i>Am I supposed
to say something?</i>

187
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
It's a nice rug.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,161
Thank you.

189
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,767
How are you feeling about
your birthday today?

190
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,881
Shit.

191
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,721
<i>She's right.
Totally forgot.</i>

192
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,089
<i>It is my
birthday today.</i>

193
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,169
Do you have
plans tonight?

194
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,811
Umm, no.

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,647
<i>In our
last session,</i>

196
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,449
we talked about
your sister.

197
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,851
We haven't
been talking.

198
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,285
Can I ask why?

199
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,049
She's one of the
reasons he comes out.

200
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,171
Talk about that.

201
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,370
Well, he's...
been gone, right'?

202
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,807
He hasn't come out since I
stopped talking to her.

203
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,570
How does that
make you feel,

204
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,290
that he's not
around anymore'?

205
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,845
It's different.

206
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,964
It's better.
For everyone.

207
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,442
You're still not
answering the question.

208
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,006
How do you feel?

209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,281
Good.

210
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,685
You miss him,
don't you?

211
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,328
It's okay
if you do.

212
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,322
I miss being a
part of something.

213
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,327
Being a part
of what, exactly?

214
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,491
Something
important.

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,650
That meant
something.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,001
Where'd you go?

217
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,205
I remembered this time
Darlene and I...

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,650
Never mind.

219
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,484
I'd love
to hear it,

220
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,529
if you don't
mind sharing it.

221
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,801
When we were kids,

222
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,804
this one year, there was
this huge snowstorm.

223
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,441
And Darlene and I
were so excited.

224
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,883
And we spent all
day just playing outside.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,083
We made this snowman,
and we called him...

226
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,130
Kevin McAllister,

227
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,481
you know, the kid
from <i>Home</i> Alone.

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,121
We were pretty obsessed
with that movie.

229
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,089
We even did the hands to the face,
like how he does in the movie.

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,285
And how'd
that turn out?

231
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,927
He just looked
like a snowman with...

232
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,123
no arms and
weird cheeks.

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,163
And we were so proud
of it, we promised

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,561
we'd steal my dad's camera and

235
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,481
take a picture of it
before it melted.

236
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,884
And what happened when
you went back out?

237
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,249
I never got
a chance to.

238
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,246
Why not?

239
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,368
That was the day
of my accident,

240
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,522
when my dad pushed
me out the window.

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,446
We were at the hospital
till pretty late.

242
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,966
Your dad pushed you
out a window?

243
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,126
Yeah.

244
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,410
I've told you
that before.

245
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,210
Elliot,
you've never...

246
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,407
No, you've never
told me this.

247
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,841
That's weird.
I remember...

248
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,961
I could have sworn I told you.

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,964
There's not much to it.

250
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,886
He pushed me
out the window.

251
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,962
I broke my arm and
went to the hospital.

252
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,366
Kevin melted.

253
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,210
Darlene was pissed.

254
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,251
End of story.

255
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,607
What made you think
of this just now?

256
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,605
I don't know.

257
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,921
<i>ANNOUNCER; Truth bombs are
coming your way, Cody-Hes.</i>

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,128
Tonight, please welcome
our special guest,

259
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,241
Joanna Wellick. Thanks
for being here.

260
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,526
Thank you
for having me.

261
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,762
Scott Knowles has, uh,
been facing charges

262
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,127
for murdering his wife,
Sharon Knowles.

263
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,245
Initially, your husband, Tyrell
Wellick, was accused of the murder,

264
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,606
until you claimed
Scott Knowles

265
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,889
confessed to killing
his wife while beating you.

266
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,441
And since then, a bartender
from the night of the party

267
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,251
has also come forward to
corroborate your story.

268
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,244
I know that this must
be difficult for you.

269
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,482
You've been brave
just coming here.

270
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,369
Do you want to tell us a little
more about what happened?

271
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,968
My lawyers have advised
me not to speak to that.

272
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,166
But what I can say,
Frank, is that

273
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,364
I didn't need Scott Knowles
to be arrested to know

274
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,405
that my husband
is innocent.

275
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,730
Mr. Knowles is...

276
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,970
clearly a
troubled man

277
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,008
and has been fixating
on us for some time.

278
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,169
I understand that
you and your son

279
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,926
have been tormented endlessly
by fanatics and paparazzi.

280
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,811
Some even went so far as to
claim you filed for divorce.

281
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,084
I did file for divorce...
a few months ago.

282
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,763
It was a moment
of weakness.

283
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,081
I listened to
the wrong people,

284
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,925
who were convincing me that
that was the right thing to do.

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,969
But I have and

286
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,442
always will be
faithful to Tyrell.

287
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,085
I have since dismissed
my petition for divorce.

288
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
He is...

289
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,244
the only man
I've ever loved

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,129
and the only man
I ever will love.

291
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,009
<i>In times
of chaos and uncertainty,</i>

292

293
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,050
<i>we look to those who've stood
with us from the beginning.</i>

296
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,964
<i>Still on your side.</i>

297
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,521
<i>Breaking news, a new

298
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,250

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,523
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

308
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,162
<i>We are fsociety.</i>

309
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,722
<i>We are malicious
and hostile.</i>

310
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,011
<i>We do not compromise.
You have been warned.</i>

311
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,769
DiPIERRO: It was released
about an hour ago

312
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,928
Six weeks,
you've given us nothing.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,604
And now we have
this to deal with?

314
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,564
That video is bullshit.

315
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,608
DiPIERRO: That video came
from the same Vimeo account

316
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,842
<i>as</i> the last one
you guys used.

317
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,569
Then it has
to be Dark Army.

318
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,926
Cisco probably
gave them access.

319
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,365
But that is not one of our guys,
okay, trust me on this...

320
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,805
You're a CHS.

321
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,087
You understand what
that means, right?

322
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
I don't understand half the
letters you guys throw at me.

323
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,121
Confidential
human source.

324
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,248
Cool. Now I get it.

325
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,961
See what speaking English
can accomplish?

326
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,647
Your job is to get intel
from Elliot on Tyrell Wellick.

327
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,643
That is the only reason
you're not in jail right now.

328
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,007
I don't know what you want
me to tell you, dude.

329
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,570
He's not talking
to Tyrell.

330
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,688
How do you
know that?

331
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,567
Five weeks ago, the night
we lost your tail...

332
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,007
And then gave us a
bullshit explanation as to

333
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,082
where you went? Yeah.

334
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,243
Stink on that
still hasn't washed off.

335
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,324
I asked Elliot point-blank,
and he said no.

336
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,124
If you don't
believe me,

337
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,248
bring him in. He'll tell
you the same thing.

338
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,890
You know that telling
Elliot anything about this

339
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,167
would violate the terms
of your immunity.

340
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,523
It would spook his
connection to Tyrell.

341
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,807
Get woke already, dude.

342
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,366
He is not nor has he ever had a
fucking relationship with Tyrell.

343
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,602
June 16, 2015.

344
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,764
<i>This is a call from Queensboro
Correctional Facility.</i>

345
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,246
Hello?

346
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,124
<i>Is it really you?</i>

347
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,366
<i>Who is this?</i>

348
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,241
<i>Bonsoir, Elliot.</i>

349
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,529
You're listening
to '80s XM radio.

350
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,407
You've been looking in the
mirror the whole drive home.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,729
I need to make a stop.

352
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,080
Stay here.

353
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,407
You want to consider
your actions carefully.

354
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,567
She fucking lied to me.

355
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,768
She went on national television
and she said she still loves him.

356
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,290
You love me!

357
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,130
I know you do!

358
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,047
You told me we were
gonna be together.

359
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,725
That's the only reason
I agreed to testify!

360
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,483
You made me lie to the
police to get Tyrell off!

361
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,324
But now I'm gonna
tell them the truth!

362
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,001
Get up.

363
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,442
If you retract your
statement, you will die.

364
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,207
I'm not being overly
emotional about this.

365
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,729
It's just that's how little
we care about your life.

366
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,282
Forget this night
ever happened, move on.

367
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,490
Marry a nice,
young lady

368
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,040
who actually finds
whatever you are charming.

369
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,804
But understand
one thing:

370
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,527
<i>As</i> certain as the pain
you're feeling right now,

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,683
there is no option
where you and Joanna ever

372
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,810
see each other again.

373
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,851
ls everything
under control?

374
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,531
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,049
He just needed
a little clarity.

376
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,326
on, okay, okay.

377
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,725
No, no, no, no, no.

378
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,249
DiPIERRO: The shooter
didn't survive.

379
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,643
The driver looks like
he's gonna pull through.

380
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
We have someone
down at the hospital,

381
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,280
ready to question,
but he's still in ICU.

382
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,964
This information
is too sensitive

383
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,246
to share
with the public.

384
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,640
We got lucky
we were on the scene

385
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,846
before anyone
saw the body.

386
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,527
What about the baby? Once you
contact the next of kin...

387
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,284
We're not
contacting them.

388
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,805
He's going
to social services.

389
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,721
Don't be soft.
Not now.

390
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,725
Her husband is the most
wanted man in the world.

391
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,404
And you and I both know
that finding him is

392
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,130
more important than
anything else, especially

393
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,248
with that goddamn video
that just got released.

394
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,004
Something about
that video.

395
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,131
I believe Darlene when
she <i>says</i> it's not real.

396
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,044
We have to assume fsociety's
grown past her at this point.

397
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,566
Yeah, but why wouldn't
she just say that then?

398
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,247
Her whole immunity's
based on giving us intel.

399
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,926
Right now all she wants to
do is protect her brother,

400
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,282
who took a job at E Corp
for Lord knows why.

401
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,203
There's no incentive
for her to lie to us.

402
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,442
She didn't even know he
was working with Tyrell.

403
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,325
Why would you
trust her on this?

404
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,569
Because I still think there's
a Dark Army connection here.

405
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,047
We have our other team
looking into them.

406
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,644
Your focus needs to stay
on Tyrell and fsociety.

407
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,961
Guys back at CART are zeroing
in on the guy in the video.

408
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,804
We might have
a good lead soon.

409
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,727
Let's just hope you're
reading your girl right.

410
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,041
I'm worried
she's at flight risk.

411
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,006
No, she's good.

412
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,481
Trust me.

413
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,284
I'm
surprised you came.

414
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,770
Thought you were going the distance
with the silent treatment.

415
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,251
If I remember correctly,

416
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,005
you were the one who told
me to go fuck myself.

417
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,450
Since when did you start
remembering everything so well?

418
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,364
Why'd you text me, Darlene?
What am I doing here?

419
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,568
Wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

420
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,851
ELLIOT; IS that all?

421
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,409
God, what is
your problem?

422
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,282
Why are you trying
to shut me out?

423
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,680
Because we can't talk.
Why not?

424
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,246
You know why.

425
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,407
Maybe I want to
hear you say it.

426
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,720
Because...

427
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,370
You're my trigger.

428
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,208
What am I, in a fucking
therapy session?

429
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
Makes sense.

430
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,646
You're my sister,
part of my childhood.

431
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,610
If I could take back
what happened to Dad, I would.

432
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,561
What happened to him
fucked me up too.

433
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,725
So don't think for a second our
shitty childhood is only yours.

434
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,203
I wish Dad were
here right now.

435
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,569
He'd know what to do.

436
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,491
I'm leaving.

437
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,326
First thing
in the morning,

438
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,607
I'm gonna crash with
a friend upstate.

439
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,089
I can't do
this anymore.

440
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,330
I can't be here.

441
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,049
Just thought you'd
want to know that.

442
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,730
Spending this last year
with you was never about

443
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,760
whatever the fuck you want
to call what we did.

444
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,409
The real reason
I did all of this

445
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,528
was so that we
could be close again.

446
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,170
I guess that's...

447
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,927
something else I thought
you'd want to know.

448
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,040
You remember when we made Kevin
McAllister, the snowman?

449
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,801
Of course.

450
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,491
Do you... Do you want
to talk about it?

451
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,088
I want you to stay
with me tonight.

452
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,002
I'm good, dude, you don't
have to worry about me.

453
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,286
It's not that.

454
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,045
I don't want
to be alone.

455
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,368
Given the ripple effect
of rapid global inflation,

456
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,366
19 of the 20 members
of this international forum

457
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,922
have signed
the Five/Nine Economic Accord,

458
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,446
making Ecoin the currency

459
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,522
by which all others
will be measured.

460
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,611
The only obstacle

461
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,684
is the illegitimate
monetary imposter

462
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,048
that China has
unofficially adopted...

463
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,366
Bitcoin.

464
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,283
China is weakening
our economic state

465
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,885
by not signing this accord,

466
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,009
and the fact that they
have embraced Bitcoin,

467
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,283
shows their resistance
and emphatic rejection

468
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,128
of our collective attempt
to rescue the global economy.

469
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,651
In short, ladies and
gentlemen...

470
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,085
They are declaring
a currency war.

471
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,371
This has to be brief.

472
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,806
Truthfully, the only reason
I even agreed to meet

473
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,764
was that this room happens
to be on my way out...

474
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,049
Have your government
sign the goddamn accord!

475
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,927
In 11 days, you'll
have what you want.

476
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,525
U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

477
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,331
but this currency
war must end.

478
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,529
The rest of the world needs
China to embrace Ecoin now.

479
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,961
We're at risk of other
countries pulling out.

480
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,122
Let me put this
as simply as I can,

481
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,443
so that we never have to
belabor this point again.

482
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,287
Your success will
always follow mine.

483
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,962
I don't give a fuck
about your accord.

484
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,641
Until I get my U.N. vote,
don't waste my time.

485
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,125
Or maybe in 11 days,

486
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,570
the administration changes its
mind about your precious U.N. vote

487
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,248
I worked so hard
to procure for you.

488
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,368
Your empty threat
reminds me

489
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,330
that there's something
I never shared with you.

490
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,761
My associates found
your pet employee

491
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,763
after she smuggled out
documents on

492
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,922
the Washington
Township plant.

493
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,010
Now that I've gotten
a chance to talk to her,

494
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,322
I can see
why you like her.

495
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,403
She makes a very
good companion.

496
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,291
And those eyes of hers...

497
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,365
I contemplated firing a
bullet into each of them,

498
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,207
but they're just
so hypnotizing.

499
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,409
Don't mistake
my generosity

500
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,610
for generosity.

501
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,811
What are you doing?

502
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,929
Why are you awake?
It's early.

503
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,203
You're not answering
my question.

504
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,602
What were you doing
by my computer?

505
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,085
I saw you
behind the monitor.

506
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,566
Jesus, I was
looking for a pen.

507
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,010
To write you a note. What's
with the fucking paranoia'?

508
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,320
A note for what?

509
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,961
I'm leaving. I have
to catch my bus.

510
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,326
The buses
aren't running.

511
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,843
There's a transportation strike,
it's all over the news.

512
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,484
Okay, the train then. What's
with the interrogation?

513
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,720
You were gonna leave
without saying good-bye.

514
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,131
Thus, the note.

515
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,123
And here I thought we were
in a good fucking place

516
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,486
after last night.

517
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,681
You're not answering
my fucking question.

518
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,966
Why are you here?

519
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,368
What do you mean?
You invited me.

520
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,010
Jesus. It's you.

521
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,406
What'd you do
with the computer'?

522
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,050
Why did you sleep here
last night?

523
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,804
You're scaring me...
Answer me!

524
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,571
Are you serious, Elliot?
Answer me!

525
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,369
You're hurting me. Stop!
Answer me!

526
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,680
Why...
Stop!

527
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,681
Stay the fuck away from
me, you fucking psycho.

528
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,571
<i>So
how does it work?</i>

529
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,563
How does what work?

530
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,804
If I wanted you
to talk to him.

531
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,121
What happened?
Did he come back?

532
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,410
I need you
to talk to him.

533
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,209
Didn't you say
that that could help'?

534
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,723
Everyone's case
is different.

535
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,040
But yes,

536
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,530
I think this
can help you.

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,126
What do we do?

538
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,051
Let's just take a moment.

539
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,730
Why don't you
sit back and relax?

540
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,890
I'd like you
to close your eyes.

541
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,846
Take a deep breath.

542
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,123
Listen to the sound
of my voice.

543
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,602
If you want me
to talk to him,

544
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,930
just let him
come to me.

545
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,408
Give him permission.

546
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,086
Elliot?

547
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,211
You should know
that nothings gonna come from this.

548
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,128
We were doing just fine.

549
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,922
Ifs nice
to finally meet you.

550
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,970
This was better when I could
just come and go as I pleased,

551
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,091
when we were whole.

552
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,729
Now I'm seeing things
that he should be seeing too.

553
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,605
We're just getting
torn apart.

554
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,290
You need to leave us alone so I
can get him back to our work.

555
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,048
Elliot never told me
how attractive you are.

556
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,044
You know, for a shrink,
you're, uh, pretty foxy.

557
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,768
Thank you, but... I'm more
interested in talking about you.

558
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,649
Come on.
Never thought about it?

559
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,404
Getting with one
of your patients?

560
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,721
That would cross some
ethical boundaries for me.

561
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,566
Sucks for you.

562
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,280
Everybody knows
crazy can be sexy.

563
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,931
So you think
you're crazy'?

564
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,001
Relax.

565
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,363
It's a figure
of speech.

566
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,605
Can I ask
for your name?

567
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,406
Well, what does
he call me?

568
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,131
Mr. Robot.
Seriously?

569
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,690
He still
calls me that?

570
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,691
Talk about labels.

571
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,804
I'd like to talk about
why you're here.

572
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,124
"A civilization which leaves
so many of its citizens"

573
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,124
"unsatisfied and
drives them into revolt"

574
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,089
"neither has nor
deserves the prospect"

575
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,810
"of a lasting existence."

576
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,961
Who said that?

577
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,331
Freud.

578
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,406
Wow. Beautiful and smart.

579
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,811
Sorry.

580
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,610
As beautiful as you are, you're
not getting inside my head.

581
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,847
Why not?

582
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,442
Because before you found out
about me, we were good.

583
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,124
I'm trying
to help him.

584
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,486
You're not trying
to help him.

585
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,403
You're trying
to destroy me.

586
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,369
I'm not trying
to destroy you.

587
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,490
Quite the opposite,
actually.

588
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,642
I want to understand you.
You understand shit.

589
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,490
You're just another
phony cooze playing friend.

590
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,044
It doesn't matter
anymore anyway.

591
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,361
Because of her,
we've been compromised.

592
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,807
She compromised us,
and Elliot didn't see it.

593
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,523
What do you mean,
you've been compromised?

594
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,562
I'm done
talking to you.

595
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,805
ELLIOT; Krista?

596
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,885
When are we
gonna start?

597
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,481
<i>What happened?
Were you there?</i>

598
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,369
<i>Did you go with me
or stay with him?</i>

599
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,487
<i>What did you see?</i>

600
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,927
<i>What did Mr. Robot mean,
"We've been compromised"?</i>

601
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,128
<i>You were there, you heard
it along with her, right?</i>

602
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,168
<i>What was Mr. Robot
talking about?</i>

603
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,682
Scan my QR code
and I'll suck your dick.

604
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,762
<i>Who compromised us?
Who's even us?</i>

605
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,683
<i>Him and me?
Or him and Tyrell?</i>

606
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,001
<i>No, he couldn't still
be working with Tyrell.</i>

607
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,646
<i>Could he?</i>

608
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,164
<i>ls Stage 2 still on?</i>

609
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,368
<i>No, I would know.
That's impossible.</i>

610
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,642
<i>Stage 2 is down.
I made sure of it.</i>

611
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,210
<i>Who compromised me?</i>

612
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,682
<i>And why do I suddenly
feel so alive?</i>

613
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,731
How do you do it?

614
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,131
How do you
get so lucky'?

615
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,688
Even when the world's
going to shit,

616
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,603
you're sitting pretty.

617
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,925
The truth is,

618
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,281
I never gave
a shit about the dog.

619
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,641
In fact,
I hate the dog.

620
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,086
Vet bills are
through the roof

621
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,447
because this little
piece of shit is sick.

622
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,921
She's been shitting all
over my house for weeks.

623
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,846
It's probably dying.

624
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,048
Figured you wanted
her so badly,

625
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,884
let her shit all
over your house.

626
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,090
Like you did mine.

627
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,569
Good job.

628
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,240
Stage 2.

629
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,567
I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

630
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,884
Whether it goes
our way or not.

631
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,122
Sir, Stage 2 is only
meant to be implemented

632
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,202
if Price doesn't
come through.

633
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,486
If the U.N. approves our
annexation of the Congo,

634
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,167
we can finally
move our operation

635
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,129
to the country's
Luwow mine.

636
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,250
Why would you still
want to carry this out,

637
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,804
given the
serious implications?

638
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,088
Ifs time Phillip Price's
hand got slapped.

639
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,050
DiPIERRO: Last time I buy
from that coffee shop.

640
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,010
They only take Ecoin.

641
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,286
Gotta use Ecoin.

642
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,442
With the exchange rate,
dollar's worth shit now.

643
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,610
DiPIERRO: You get anything
from Elliot's computer?

644
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,489
He hasn't
logged in all day.

645
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,967
Last night he sent an
encrypted email with a link.

646
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,204
Could be lucky, could be
sending it to Tyrell, right?

647
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,964
Is this from
last night?

648
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,325
Oh, also
I was able to get

649
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,687
a clean audio recording
of his place.

650
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,171
Seriously?
Yeah.

651
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,210
He dropped some good intel.
Here, let me play it for you.

652
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,041
That'll be stuck in
my head all day now.

653
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,321
DiPIERRO: Turn it Off.

654
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,284
Is that coming
from downstairs?

655
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,729
Yeah, that's
Darlene's apartment, but...

656
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,131
who the fuck is that?

657
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,686
Is Darlene home?
No, she's out.

658
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,648
You think she told
someone about the safe house?

659
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,011
DiPIERRO: This email he sent
from his computer,

660
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,645
did you go to this link?

661
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,201
Yeah, downloaded
the file, opened it,

662
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,044
but didn't find anything.

663
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,882
This email
isn't for Tyrell.

664
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,971
It's for us.
