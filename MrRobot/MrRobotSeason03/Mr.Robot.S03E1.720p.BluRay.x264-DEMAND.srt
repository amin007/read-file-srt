1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,890
There's a reason we met.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,891
There's something between us.
I can see it.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,168
You're only seeing
what's in front of you.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,323
You're not seeing
what's above you.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,366
<i>This is going to be
affecting our economy</i>

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,807
<i>in ways that are
extraordinarily significant.</i>

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,245
<i>The FBI announced today</i>

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,482
that Tyrell Wellick
and fsociety

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,846
<i>engaged in this attack.</i>

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,961
<i>Blackouts. Why?</i>

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>So they can take away
your power.</i>

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,011
<i>The public
is hoarding cash.</i>

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,889
<i>The housing market
is grinding to a halt.</i>

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,291
<i>Dark Army.
They got no code.</i>

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,964
<i>They hack for anyone.

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,201
<i>Tell me about your father.</i>

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,281
We were close.

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,885
Worked at Evil Corp
his whole life.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,088
One of the best computer
engineers they had.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,003
One day, he told me
he had leukemia.

21
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,570
<i>They are going to
try and get rid of me again,</i>

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,210
and I need you
to not let them.

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,089
<i>He is a part of you
that makes you, you.</i>

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,571
Who are you talking to?

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,962
<i>Twenty-six employees died
in the widely-publicized</i>

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,526
<i>Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.</i>

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,206
If I told you that your mother
and Elliot's father

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,009
died for a reason,
would it make a difference?

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,844
<i>That they were sacrificed
for the greater good,</i>

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,208
<i>that they gave their lives to
take humanity to the next level?</i>

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,567
Tyrell, are you there?
They told me you would be calling.

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,971
This is a secure line.

33
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,764
<i>You sure you still
don't want to talk to me?</i>

34
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,086
We got to show her
we're smarter.

35
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,366
<i>They're going to try
and flip her.</i>

36
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,283
<i>Let me do it alone.
I know her.</i>

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,169
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

38
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,084
<i>This gets
his phone mic live.</i>

39
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,322
<i>I'm going to ask him
about Stage 2.</i>

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,041
<i>The Dark Army set this up?
They're our partners.</i>

41
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,963
<i>It's Elliot.
He's the one with the plan.</i>

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,405
When is Stage 2?

43
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,010
<i>Femtocell the backdoor.</i>

44
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,605
<i>You planned all of that
with him?</i>

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,125
<i>You're not hacking anything.</i>

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,202
<i>This will level that building
and kill people.</i>

47
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,731
I'm going to get rid of
the backdoor.

48
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,086
We're supposed
to be gods together,

49
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,764
and yet you want to
destroy our destiny?

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,047
Step away from the computer!

51
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,810
You touch that keyboard,
and I will shoot you.

52
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,247
No, you won't.
You can't.

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,646
It doesn't exist.

54
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,563
This control you think you have...

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,607
It's an illusion.

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,364
I'm the only one that exists.

57
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,201
Ifs time to finally
take back control.

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,291
<i>Real control.</i>

59
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>"So much depends
on a red wheelbarrow.</i>

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,487
<i>"Glazed with rainwater
beside the white chickens."</i>

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,365
You know,
once you gave me this,

62
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,444
you said to stop anyone who
gets in the way of our plan.

63
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,687
Sorry, kiddo.

64
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,445
I couldn't let
anyone stop this.

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,806
Including us.

66
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,971
Looks like you're going to get
a free milkshake, you lucky dog.

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,726
I'll take chocolate, please.

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,248
Oh, sorry, sir. That offer is
only valid on your next visit.

69
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,007
I don't understand.

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,648
I got my punches.
Didn't you just say

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,006
I could have
a free milkshake?

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,003
Yes, and you can redeem it
on your next visit.

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,686
What's the difference?
I'm here now.

74
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,008
I'm sorry, sir.
That's not the way it works.

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,451
Okay, should I just get out of
line and then get back in'?

76
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,683
No, sir. You would have to redeem
it on your next visit here.

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,328
Okay. What qualifies
<i>as</i> a visit?

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,562
Do I have to leave the
premises and come back?

79
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,287
Do I have to go home?

80
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,766
Is it time-based?

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,043
You see the faulty logic here,
don't you?

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,964
Sir, those are the rules.

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,600
You can speak to the manager,

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,523
or I'd be happy to add
a milkshake to your order

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,329
for$12.95.

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,561
It's not about the money.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,801
It's about the principle.

88
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,208
Sir, there's nothing
I can do.

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,526
Uh-huh.

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,001
Calm down.

91
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,801
No...

92
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,722
Screaming isn't going to help
this situation, is it?

93
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,489
Uh-huh. Yeah, well,

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,449
I agree.
It's not good.

95
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,601
Is he dead?

96
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,482
Uh-huh. All right.

97
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,646
Be there in 15 minutes.

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,050
When we lose our principles,

99
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,846
we invite chaos.

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,411
Thank God you're here.
I...

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,882
I don't know how
it got to this.

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,764
Please,

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,841
tell me you can help him.

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
He... He can't die.
He can't die.

105
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,008
Well, he's kinda still alive.

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,250
This wasn't what
I meant by "safekeeping."

107
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,642
Please, just tell me, I need to know.
Is he going to live?

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,488
The doctors are en route.

109
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,484
And they're about
two minutes out.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,607
Camera...

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,202
Uh... You know,

112
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,450
pushing on his stomach
like that...

113
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,523
That's, uh...
That's not helping things.

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,806
You might want to stop that.

115
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,681
Uh-uh.

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,087
Well,

117
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,081
our people are working
on him <i>as</i> we speak.

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,161
Uh-huh.

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,761
Uh-huh.

120
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,281
Just went in to surgery.

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,281
Uh-huh.

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Well...

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,165
What do you want me to do
about the Swede?

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,287
Uh-huh.

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,170
And as far <i>as</i> the kid goes?

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,806
Uh-huh.

127
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,447
Ready when you are.

128
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,361
Okeydoke.

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>I love</i>
a <i>great mystery.</i>

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,882
<i>And I'm fascinated by the
greatest unsolved mystery.</i>

131
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,886
<i>Do we see reality as it is?</i>

132
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,406
If I close my eyes
and imagine...

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,040
That, ladies and gentlemen,

134
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
is why it's always smart
to have backup generators

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,011
at a nuclear power plant.

136
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,481
And as I was saying,

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,928
if I close my eyes,
I can imagine

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,002
that everything we experience,

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,930
everything we see,
think, and do,

140
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,482
is unfolding simultaneously

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,444
in a parallel universe.

142
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,441
And if So,

143
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,007
how many copies
of ourselves exist?

144
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,126
And might our mental states
be conjoined?

145
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,680
For better or worse.

146
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,410
He really is a crazy
little goose, isn't he?

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,768
No, no, no.
Remember what we said.

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,245
Practice makes perfect.

149
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,481
Sir,

150
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,521
I think they are both
incredibly unstable people.

151
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,286
Let me run Stage 2 for you.

152
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,608
I am more than capable.

153
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,811
Have I ever told you that
Mr. Alderson's father

154
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,121
used to work for us
on this project?

155
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,361
Unbeknownst to him, of course.

156
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,328
In fact, it was his great
engineering work

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,562
that led to some of our
early successes.

158
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,164
What an extraordinary
coincidence.

159
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,282
That now his son works for us
after so many years.

160
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,411
But you don't believe
in coincidence.

161
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,965
Yes, I don't,

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,761
which is why you misunderstand
Mr. Anderson's value.

163
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,531
It was his impassioned plea
to destroy E Corp

164
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,648
that presented us
with the opportunity

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,530
to set our plan in motion,
and it has taken

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,047
his relentless determination
since to continue it.

167
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,204
We may possess
the necessary tools,

168
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,770
but what we do not have

169
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,242
is his unadulterated focused

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,360
rage.

171
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,687
Time presented us Mr. Alderson
when we needed him.

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,885
Therefore, his will
must be our guide.

173
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,927
And after Mr. Alderson
completes the great work

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,445
that we need from him,

175
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,849
then he can die for us.

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,051
Just like his father.

177
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,201
<i>Are you still there?</i>

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,121
<i>Am I?</i>

179
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
<i>What did we miss?</i>

180
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,605
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

181
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,926
<i>I blacked out.</i>

182
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,411
<i>If I'm alive,
I must have been right.</i>

183
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,926
<i>None of it was real.</i>

184
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,325
<i>I'm the one in control.</i>

185
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,405
<i>The one with the power.</i>

186
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,408
<i>But why doesn't it
feel that way?</i>

187
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,607
You're awake.

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,405
The electricity's still out.

189
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,765
It's been out a week now.

190
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,126
What am I doing here'?

191
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,725
They brought you here yesterday.

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,241
You don't remember.

193
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,931
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,046
Who brought me here?

195
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,449
The people
that you're working with.

196
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,926
They called me.

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,931
They told me
that you were hurt.

198
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,246
What people?

199
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,961
I don't know
who they are.

200
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,964
I only recognized one of them.

201
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,521
Who?

202
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,801
Tyrell Wellick.

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,806
Shit.
<i>It</i> was real.

204
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>It actually happened.</i>

205
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,921
<i>The gun.</i>

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,047
Slow down.

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,801
You've been shot.

208
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,604
<i>And like that,
my power is gone too.</i>

209
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,803
I just did
what they told me to do.

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,281
I was scared.

211
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,607
Angela...

212
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,762
you have to tell me
how I got here.

213
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,564
I was on my way
to turn myself in to the FBI,

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,843
and I was stopped by
the Dark Army.

215
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,129
They sent a man
to my apartment.

216
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,565
Elliot, you can't get up.

217
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,051
I have to warn the police.

218
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,006
You can't do that.

219
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,562
If you tell the police anything,
they're going to kill me.

220
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,041
<i>911 center is
experiencing high call volume.</i>

221
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,402
<i>For power outage updates,
use 511.</i>

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,970
They made that very clear.

223
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,131
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,001
<i>Hello?</i>

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,002
Then I have to go there.

226
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,161
Go where'?

227
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,528
I need to find him.
Who?

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,847
Tyrell.

229
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,850
Are you crazy?
He shot you.

230
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,605
They're trying to blow up
Evil Corp's recovery facility.

231
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,849
Hold on.
I have to stop them.

232
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,002
How can you be <i>so</i> sure that
that's what they're doing?

233
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,963
You've been unconscious
for the past six days.

234
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,041
Maybe you're wrong.

235
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,681
What if I'm not'?

236
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,725
Do you have something
I can wear?

237
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,771
<i>They did
a full wipe-down.</i>

238
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,441
<i>Where is Tyrell?</i>

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,370
<i>And something else is off.</i>

240
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,244
<i>That ever-looming presence
that is Mr. Robot.</i>

241
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,921
<i>I don't feel it.</i>

242
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,287
<i>Is it possible
that the bullet killed him,</i>

243
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,281
<i>and not me?</i>

244
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,250
<i>The mark of the beast
is the mark of the elite.</i>

245
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,609
One world government
is a myth.

246
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,841
Fear the one world corporation.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,844
The beast has many titles.

248
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,490
Prince of darkness,

249
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,650
Lord of Lies, Ruler of Hell.

250
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,881
Oh, Elliot. Hey.

251
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,124
Let your visitor know I got
plenty of vacant apartments.

252
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,442
We got to get some of
these things rented,

253
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,170
or else we're all
going to get screwed.

254
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,527
That's why I upgraded
the facade, you know.

255
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,602
It used to be this ugly red.
Now it's this chrome.

256
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,648
I think it's very inviting.
What visitor?

257
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,606
Whoever's in your apartment.

258
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,330
Just tell him
we're running a special.

259
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,164
Utilities included.

260
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,370
Where the fuck have you been'?

261
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,841
You shouldn't be here.

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,571
Why are you walking like that?

263
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,328
You can't just disappear on me
for days and not say anything.

264
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,447
Shut the fuck up.

265
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,921
There are men outside.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,047
They might be listening.

267
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,481
We have to go.

268
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,085
I need to talk to you
about something.

269
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,924
It's not safe for you here.
Cisco's dead.

270
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,085
Dark Army turned on us.

271
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,242
They killed him,
and I think I'm next.

272
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,041
What happened?

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,290
We were having dinner, and all
of a sudden, gunshots went off.

274
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,969
The slowest three seconds
of my life.

275
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,649
The FBI even questioned me.

276
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,681
So yeah, it's not safe
for me anywhere.

277
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,522
In fact, everywhere for me
is pretty much fucked.

278
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,246
What did you tell them?

279
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,121
The FBI?

280
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,081
God.

281
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,449
You're a shitty brother,
you know that?

282
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,929
I could've been dead, Elliot.

283
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,681
Sorry.

284
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,330
What is this about, anyway?

285
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,480
Stage 2?

286
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,486
The phone we hacked before
you did your vanishing act.

287
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,970
The hot mic picked it all up.

288
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,769
Stage 2 is your plan,
isn't it?

289
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,641
Elliot?

290
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,764
What is Stage 2?

291
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
The femtocell
you had Angela install.

292
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,247
Yeah, so? That was for a hack
on the FBI.

293
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,005
That wasn't
the only reason.

294
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,927
It created a backdoor
inside Evil Corp.

295
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,806
It was to get access to the UPSs
inside one of their buildings.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,081
What building'?

297
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,767
The building

298
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,842
that's housing
their recovery program.

299
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,363
All their backup
paper records, titles,

300
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,488
deeds, loan documents...

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,365
Jesus.

302
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,209
Oh, you were... You were just
going to blow it up?

303
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,521
This is what you meant
by "finishing off Evil Corp."

304
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,001
They'd have no chance
at rebuilding their database.

305
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,447
You were planning this with
them all along behind my back.

306
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,567
No, no, it wasn't like that.

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,642
Because you didn't think
I'd go along with it?

308
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,771
Killing all of those people?

309
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,046
It wasn't me!

310
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,407
Wasn't me.

311
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,007
I can stop it.

312
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,131
I can stop this.

313
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,645
I can stop it.
I can stop it.

314
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,006
You're not going to get
online here.

315
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,525
Internet's been down for days.

316
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,729
If I can close the backdoor,

317
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,046
I can stop it.

318
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,041
Darlene,

319
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,841
please help me.

320
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,328
I know a space
that has access.

321
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,924
But you're not going to get
in there wearing that shirt.

322
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,360
You got to be
kidding me, man.

323
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,521
No, that's the cost.

324
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,926
Come on. MAN 2; How
are you going to pay?

325
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,685
Looks a little busy.

326
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,850
The only hacker space with a
dedicated fiber connection.

327
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,969
Stay here, I'll find us
a way to get on.

328
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,805
<i>A CTF tournament.</i>

329
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,361
<i>Capture the flag.</i>

330
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,564
<i>It's like the hacker Olympics.</i>

331
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,085
<i>Teams around the world
compete to solve challenges.</i>

332
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,682
<i>Reverse-engineering protocol
exploitation, forensics.</i>

333
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,800
<i>The entire city's
suffering an energy crisis</i>

334
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,451
<i>while they're here, exercising
their inner anarchy.</i>

335
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,810
<i>It's times like these
I really wish</i>

336
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,370
<i>I had a mute button for life.</i>

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
<i>Isn't that better?</i>

338
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,406
We're fucked.
All the machines are taken.

339
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,841
They're in the middle
of the final round

340
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,729
of the qualifier
for a CTF.

341
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,325
Ifs them versus
nine other countries,

342
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,880
and from the scoreboard,
the Koreans are ride or die.

343
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,643
It's going to take forever
before this is over.

344
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,810
Or I could just
win it for them.

345
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,164
They let you save
and load your game,

346
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,730
restoring all the mines
you found

347
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,086
and all the shells
you cleared.

348
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,726
That's the weakness.

349
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,843
The game trusts
whatever data you give it

350
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,081
to recreate the board.

351
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,647
Poison the data.

352
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,290
You can make it run
whatever code you want.

353
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,610
Yeah. We already
thought about that.

354
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,966
It won't work.
There's a server-side key

355
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,166
used to verify the game saves.

356
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,163
And without it,
you just get a checksum error,

357
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,361
which is why
you play the game

358
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,090
until you find
the mines first.

359
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,921
Once you know the full board,
you can derive the key.

360
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,966
And you already spotted
the code injection vuln

361
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,605
in the save handler
function, right'?

362
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,531
Shit.
I never thought of that.

363
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,960
Dude, just let him on.

364
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,767
No way, man.

365
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,885
Need I remind you,
I was a CyberPatriot finalist.

366
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,605
Yeah, in middle school.

367
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,007
If we don't make the top three,
we're not going to Vegas.

368
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,764
And he knows this shit
better than you.

369
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,167
Fuck it, I've been at
this for four fucking hours.

370
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,651
I gotta deuce it out anyway.

371
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,610
This Soylent ain't
for the faint-hearted.

372
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,324
I see them.
Stay calm.

373
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,161
It's Dark Army.
It's me they want, not you.

374
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,009
You having an attack?
It's okay.

375
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,085
Don't stop, okay?
I'll be fine.

376
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,684
Fuck!

377
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,926
You need to help me.

378
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,325
There's Dark Army everywhere.

379
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,489
I saw them.
They have guns.

380
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,881
PRESS.

381
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,571
Shit.

382
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,490
Dude! Dude, I can't believe
it only took you two minutes

383
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,721
to win the final round.

384
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,842
Can you please take your hand
off me and leave me alone?

385
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,043
Yeah. Dude, I...
I was just...

386
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,167
Thank you.

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,321
<i>The backdoor

388

Elliot.

394
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,002
I'm almost done.
I shut the backdoor.

395
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,286
I just have to uninstall...

396
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,848
Stand up and walk with us.

397
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,887
Do it.

398
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,570
Go down Cortlandt Alley.

399
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,643
What are you doing?
This is them.

400
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,570
It's them I want to see.

401
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
Get in.

402
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,769
We're good, man.
No, you're not.

403
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,687
That car she's eyeballing
is FBI.

404
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,887
They're following you.

405
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,009
Been following you
since you left the apartment.

406
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,241
You're gonna want to get in.

407
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,211
Hey, miss, grab my laptop.

408
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,049
Should be on the floor
right below you there.

409
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,406
Pull up the motor vehicle
lookup tool, would you?

410
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,962
Sorry
about the mess.

411
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,844
Been a while
since I had time to clean it.

412
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,321
But hey, gas prices
what they are right now,

413
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,050
taxis are a premium,
so, you know,

414
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,444
you're welcome
for the free cab ride.

415
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,848
Now, Elliot,
do me a favor, would you'?

416
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,049
Read her the license plate
of the car

417
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,805
that's been tailing us.
UVM 7482.

418
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,847
All right, good.

419
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,725
Now, miss.
Input that plate number.

420
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,122
Grab the VIN number.
Put it on a

421
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,646
sticky note. I got 'em in the side
door there, along with a pen.

422
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,562
<i>OnStar center. This is Debbie.
How may I help you?</i>

423
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,971
Yeah, I need to report
an emergency.

424
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,684
This is Detective
Robert Abernathy,

425
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,331
badge number 8301,
out of the 19 precinct.

426
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,081
Get that number?

427
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,809
Yeah, I got a stolen vehicle.
Driving erratically,

428
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,568
and almost hitting pedestrians
during the outage here.

429
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,447
Yeah, I'm gonna pursue
for about ten minutes.

430
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,643
Yeah, I have line of sight
of the vehicle.

431
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,364
I need to initiate a slowdown.

432
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,844
Okay. VIN number,
here we go:

433
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,130
1-H-G-C,

434
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,444

F as in Franklin,

00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,407
Two.

440
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,087
Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.

441
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,321
I see the lights blinking.

442
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,121
Thank you, GUYS-

443
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,601
All right.

444

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,491
<i>This must be the guy that
sent me that fucking menu.</i>

451
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,806
Do me a favor, miss.

452
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,242
Go get us a couple
of number fours.

453
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,171
On me. Oh.

454
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,563
And make sure
they punch my card.

455
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm not going anywhere.

456
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,722
Well, I got business
with your brother, here.

457
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,410
Now, the faster
we get that rolling,

458
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,970
the faster you two can leave.

459
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,321
It's okay.

460
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,001
I'll go stand over there,

461
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,367
but I'm not getting you
a fucking number four.

462
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,161
What about my punch card?

463
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,251
And don't call me "miss."

464
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,251
Well, she's
full of life, huh?

465
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,889
Let's get to what
this is about.

466
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,081
Well...

467
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,724
We hear you've been
running around town-.

468
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,524
The doc says
you should be resting.

469
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,686
I had shit to do.

470
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,328
Well, you want to catch
me up on where we're at?

471
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,006
I shut the backdoor.

472
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,930
Now, why would you go do
a thing like that?

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,968
I'm calling
this operation off.

474
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,640
You sure you want to do that'?

475
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,840
We've gone to great lengths...

476
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,160
It's not negotiable.

477
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,804
And if there's a problem
with my request,

478
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,927
you can deal with me.

479
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,161
And only me.

480
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,571
I suppose our employer
will be disappointed.

481
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,801
I don't have an employer.

482
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,721
Uh-huh.

483
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,770
Well...

484
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,287
She believes that a plan lives
or dies by its creator, so...

485
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,080
if you want it dead,
so be it.

486
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,407
Where are you going?

487
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,921
Oh, I want to go home.

488
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,806
And they canceled
the Mets game,

489
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,121
so I'll probably end up
working on my book a little.

490
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,931
So that's it?
That's it.

491
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,691
I want confirmation.

492
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,047
From her.

493
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,521
You know that bullet
we took out of you?

494
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,008
We can easily
put it right back in.

495
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,166
You won. Go home.

496
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,243
Before you end up
losing again.

497
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,447
What happened?

498
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,047
It's over.

499
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,364
They're calling off
Stage 2.

500
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,641
Just like that?

501
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,841
Just like that.

502
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,647
I don't buy it.

503
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,361
We'd both be dead
if they wanted to stop us.

504
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,291
That tends to be their response
when they disagree with you.

505
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,729
And who are "they," exactly?

506
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,284
Is this just Dark Army, or

507
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,527
is Tyrell Wellick
involved in all of this, too?

508
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,248
I know a lot more
than you think, Elliot.

509
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
Answer the question.

510
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,163
Is Tyrell Wellick involved'?

511
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,281
Has he been a part of this whole
thing from the beginning?

512
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,847
No.

513
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,603
Look, even if they were lying,

514
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,648
I closed their only access.

515
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,726
You want to bury your head
in the sand, be my guest.

516
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,887
But my eyes are staying
wide fucking open.

517
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,050
The only thing that matters
is that we survive this thing.

518
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,446
We got out alive,

519
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,082
which happens to be
a luxury right now.

520
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,642
We don't know where Trenton
and Mobley are,

521
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,085
but they're probably dead.

522
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,249
And we know what happened
to Cisco.

523
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,126
Go fuck yourself.

524
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,201
<i>Darlene's right.</i>

525
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,766
<i>I can't trust them.</i>

526
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,571
<i>This was too easy.</i>

527
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,321
<i>But at least I stopped them
for now.</i>

528
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,484
<i>I can go home knowing that.</i>

529
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,370
But was she right about me?

530
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,524
Am I sticking my head
in the sand?

531
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,288
Did my revolution
just bury our minds,

532
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,566
instead of freeing them?

533
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,330
Encrypting Evil Corp's data
was meant to empower us.

534
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,804
Instead, it left us powerless,

535
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,521
scaring us into
even more submission.

536
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,441
I am not going to get rid
of the invisible hand.

537
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,084
Turned it into a fist
that punched us in the dick.

538
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,041
And like a botnet,
the fear I created

539
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,361
is spreading so fast,
it's practically airborne.

540
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,608
<i>It's swallowed us whole,
digested us,</i>

541
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,284
<i>and now we're stuck
in its asshole,</i>

542
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,606
<i>waiting to be dumped out.</i>

543
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,727
<i>And while we're here,</i>

544
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,291
<i>they're having their way
with us.</i>

545
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,567
<i>They packaged a fight
into product.</i>

546
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,481
<i>Turned our dissent</i>

547
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,690
into intellectual property.

548
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,931
Televising our revolution
with commercial breaks.

549
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,370
They backdoored into our minds
and robbed our truth,

550
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,171
refurbished the facts,
then marked up the price.

551
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,287
This is what they do.

552
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,160
It's what they're good at.
This is their greatest trick.

553
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,641
To try and bring the truth.

554
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,171
They're trying
to take that away.

555
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,446
And now they're moving
to the next step.

556
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,522
Yeah, next step. You know
what the next step is?

557
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,405
Lobotomizing us into their
virtual reality horror show.

558
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,522
Why? So they can
take away your power,

559
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,807
and lam not talking
about your electricity.

560
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,930
And this all started because
I tried to hide from society.

561
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,207
Remember?

562
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,367
Fuck society.

563
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,488
Yeah, well, I fucked society,
all right.

564
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,080
<i>I reset it to zero,</i>

565
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,440
and if I don't do anything
about it,

566
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,761
it will continue to grow
in this malignant way.

567
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,569
And that's what I'm afraid
of the most.

568
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,041
This dark future
that I set into motion.

569
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,284
Who knows
what could come from this?

570
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,806
Thank you,
thank you very much.

571
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,968
<i>What if instead
of fighting back, we caved,</i>

572
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,042
<i>gave away our privacy
for security,</i>

573
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,884
<i>exchanged dignity for safety,</i>

574
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,122
<i>and traded revolution
for repression?</i>

575
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,408
What if we choose weakness
over strength?

576
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,849
<i>These are not the people
that made our country great.</i>

577
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,924
These are the people that
are destroying our country.

578
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,044
They'll even have us
build our own prison.

579
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,770
<i>This is what
they wanted all along.</i>

580
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,402
For us to buy in
on our worst selves.

581
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,604
<i>And I just made it easier
for them.</i>

582
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,604
I didn't start a revolution.

583
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,087
I just made us docile enough
for their slaughtering.

584
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,443
<i>And I can stand here
and blame Evil Corp</i>

585
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,285
<i>and every other conglomerate out
there for taking advantage of us,</i>

586
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,171
<i>blame the FBI, NSA, CIA,</i>

587
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,651
<i>for letting them
get away with this,</i>

588
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,331
<i>blame all the world's leaders
for aiding and abetting them,</i>

589
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,401
blame Adam Smith

590
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,164
<i>for inventing modern-day
capitalism</i>

591
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,401
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

592
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,251
<i>Blame money for dividing us,
blame us for letting it.</i>

593
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,046
But none of that's true.

594
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,646
The truth is...

595
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,806
I'm the one to blame.

596
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,841
I'm the problem.

597
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,400
This was my fault.

598
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,087
All of ii.

599
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,731
I did this.

600
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,481
Fuck me.

601
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,407
Sir?

602
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,086
We're closing up.

603
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,170
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

604
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,969
I need a job at Evil Corp.

605
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,361
What?

606
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,682
I need to find a way
to fix what I did.

607
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,806
You need to give me
a job there.

608
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,241
I don't know
that I can just do that.

609
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,486
With everything
they've been through,

610
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,006
they must need people to work
on their recovery program.

611
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,407
I need you to try.
This is important.

612
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,847
Okay.

613
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,846
<i>I'll try.</i>

614
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,401
One more thing.

615
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,329
I need you to keep
an eye on me.

616
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,446
I need you to tell me

617
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,205
if I'm ever him.

618
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,971
If anyone can tell...

619
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,527
It's you.

620
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,609
Why do you think I can tell?

621
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,164
You know me better than anyone.

622
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,241
Right now...

623
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,922
You're the only person
I can trust.

624
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,127
Sorry.

625
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
What happened before,

626
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,805
when we kissed,
that was a mistake.

627
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,122
<i>If you're wondering
if this hurts...</i>

628
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,411
<i>Yeah.
It hurts a lot, but...</i>

629
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,647
I get it.

630
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,562
<i>I've known Angela
since I was eight.</i>

631
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,285
<i>This is what she does.</i>

632
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,361
<i>She doesn't love the people
who love her.</i>

633
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,004
<i>She loves the people
who don't.</i>

634
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,363
<i>This is her power-saver mode.</i>

635
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,361
What's wrong?

636
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,850
I have to tell you something.

637
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,841
What?

638
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,691
What if I told you
we could make it

639
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,285
like none of this
ever happened'?

640
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,850
You mean Five/Nine?

641
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,010
No, not just that.

642
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,525
I mean, everything.

643
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,562
Including what happened
to our parents.

644
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,202
If we could take it all back,
from the beginning,

645
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,571
what would you be willing
to sacrifice for that?

646
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,369
Angela,
what you're talking about,

647
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,210
that's not possible.

648
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,450
What if I told you it is'?

649
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,161
How?

650
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,047
Never mind.

651
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,486
I'm just tired.
I think I should go to bed.

652
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,725
Can you stay here tonight?

653
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,969
It's been a rough
couple of months.

654
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,400
Just make me feel safe.

655
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,367
Yeah.

656
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,847
Elliot?

657
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,207
It's me.

658
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,807
Come closer.

659
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,444
I need to get dressed.

660
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,006
And then we'll go.

661
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,367
Did you convince him
Stage 2 is over?

662
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,806
That's been taken care of.

663
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,451
We need to pick up Darlene.
She should be a part of this.

664
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,641
No.

665
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,770
In fact, you need to stay
away from her.

666
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,600
We can't trust her.

667
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,364
She helped Elliot
close the backdoor.

668
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,087
Come again?

669
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,727
She did what?

670
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,411
The backdoor is closed?

671
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,607
YES.

672
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,206
Why are you
so calm about this?

673
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,248
We're going to find a way
to get back on the network.

674
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,129
Is that all?
We'll be fine.

675
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,248
This isn't about the backdoor.
It's about him.

676
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,688
Anything we do,
he will try to slow us down.

677
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,604
As long as he exists,
he will stop us.

678
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,047
Then we'll find a way
to redirect his energy.

679
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,560
Come on.
They're expecting us.

680
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,767
What's that for?

681
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,283
In case Elliot comes back.

682
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,046
How can you tell?

683
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,761
That it's me?

684
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,246
How do you know that you're
not talking to him right now?

685
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,441
Your eyes.

686
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,450
You're never trying to look away.

687
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,807
Are you all right?

688
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,566
When I saw him earlier tonight,

689
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,802
he was all hell-bent
on not doing this.

690
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,120
How'd you change his mind?

691
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,880
ANGELA; You have to remember,
he woke up

692
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,201
with a gunshot wound
in his stomach.

693
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,881
He's still getting his
bearings, but he's fine now.

694
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,284
Somethings rotten about all this.

695
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,930
When we spoke earlier,

696
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,968
he was looking at me
like we'd never met.

697
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,729
You brought me in
to manage him.

698
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,731
And that's exactly
what I've done.

699
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,165
Nothing else matters, does it?

700
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,607
Thank you
for getting me the time

701
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,886
before checking in with her.

702
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,450
Don't thank me too quickly.

703
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,002
We're behind schedule now, and we both
know how she feels about punctuality.

704
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,847
One more thing.

705
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,724
I'm going to get him
a job at Evil Corp.

706
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,411
Doesn't hurt to have him on the
inside, given our situation.

707
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,883
Are you sure
he's good to go'?

708
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,887
YES.

709
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,924
You have to understand, I...

710
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,609
thought you were
dismantling our project.

711
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,330
You were ruining
our whole mission

712
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,768
that we sacrificed
and worked hard to build.

713
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,521
It's okay.

714
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,965
You did what I asked of you.

715
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,209
Still... could've had
better aim, though.

716
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,442
It takes a lot
to miss every vital organ.

717
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,082
That's some pretty
piss-poor marksmanship.

718
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,491
What? I'm messing with you.

719
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,766
Just trying to break
the ice a little.

720
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,687
Come on.

721
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,520
Still have plenty of work to do.

722
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,926
We reestablish access
that tunnels us right back

723
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,002
in Evil Corp's internal network.

724
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,047
I got to ask,

725
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,763
what is in this for you?
Why are you doing this?

726
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,004
Like I told you before,

727
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,126
I'm not going to talk to you
like I talk to Elliot.

728
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,524
You and I,
we are not friends.

729
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,250
It's precisely
that you're besties with him

730
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,561
that I'm trying to understand how
you can lie to him so blatantly.

731
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,245
How could I be lying to him'?

732
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,043
I'm literally looking
right at him.

733
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,531
That's certainly a creative
way to get out of this.

734
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,811
But let's be real.

735
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,642
You are taking advantage
of Elliot's

736
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,571
let's call it
"unique" condition.

737
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,321
He started this, didn't he?

738
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,125
I'm just helping him
finish it.

739
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,091
I'm pushing him along.

740
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,926
Isn't that what you do'?

741
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,281
That is what I do.

742
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,369
If you want me to keep on doing

743
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,044
what it is that I do,

744
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,884
we're going to have
to trust each other.

745
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,361
Right now, Angela,

746
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,729
I do not trust you.

747
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,450
So I'm going to ask you
one more time.

748
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,365
Why, exactly,
are you doing all of this?

749
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,249
Evil Corp killed my mom.

750
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,125
And my whole life...

751
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,802
I've always wanted justice
for her death.

752
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,571
But how do you bring
justice to a...

753
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,526
conglomerate
as untouchable as Evil Corp'?

754
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,651
I thought I would never win.

755
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,007
Even after I found out
about your crazy plan,

756
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,162
I still didn't believe
it was possible.

757
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,249
Not until I met Whiterose.

758
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,685
It wasn't until
she opened my eyes

759
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,360
that I could see how

760
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,328
all of the damage
that they've caused

761
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,329
could finally be undone.

762
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,725
When we succeed...

763
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,450
A whole new world will be horn.

764
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,364
Looks like
the power's back on.
