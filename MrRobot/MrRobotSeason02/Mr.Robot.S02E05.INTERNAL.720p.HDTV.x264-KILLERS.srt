1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,383
We might be owned.

2
00:00:01,408 --> 00:00:02,063
Dark Army.

3
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,656
The world's most dangerous hacker crew.

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,661
They think the FBI's
even snooping around,

5
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:07,585
and it gets ugly.

6
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,367
They keep asking me questions.

7
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:10,925
I'm gonna keep telling your story,

8
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,468
but if shit goes down and I get busted,

9
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:13,769
I'm not gonna get locked up.

10
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,705
My husband will return soon,

11
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,340
and this'll all be over.

12
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,874
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's

13
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,476
climate control system.

14
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:24,013
Take care of yourself.

15
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:25,214
There will be fallout from this,

16
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:26,249
and I'm gonna tell them...

17
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,616
I used your computer,

18
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,452
so tell them whatever you want.

19
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,220
The server keeps crashing. I
don't know how to stop it.

20
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:32,521
We need to find someone who can do

21
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,023
that migration thing
he keep talking about.

22
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:36,392
You hack people. I hack time.

23
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:40,229
_

24
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:41,964
Someone's closing in on us.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,499
I have to find out what they know.

26
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,534
My online business is
very important to me.

27
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,836
I prefer discretion.

28
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,871
What exactly are you doing?

29
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:50,706
I'm hacking the FBI.

30
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,334
_

31
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,596
Step one: identify the
target and its flaws.

32
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,097
There are always flaws.

33
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,866
I learned that early in life.

34
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,035
My first hack, the local library,

35
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,571
a vulnerable FTP server in its as400.

36
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:25,207
A far cry from the Android
zero days I'm using

37
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:28,244
to own the FBI
standard-issue smartphone.

38
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,745
The library was a test to see

39
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,048
if I could even get into the system.

40
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,016
I've since set greater goals.

41
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,918
For instance, step two:

42
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:38,521
build malware and prepare an attack.

43
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,057
At my fingertips, the zero
day is wrapped in code

44
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:44,293
like a Christmas present,
then becomes an exploit,

45
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:48,364
the programmatic expression of my will.

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,132
I live for this shit.

47
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,405
Step three: a reverse
shell, two-stage exploit.

48
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,207
The ideal package.

49
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:01,043
Load the malware into a
femtocell delivery system,

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,645
my personal cell tower

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,114
that'll intercept all mobile data.

52
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,816
Similar to my first time,

53
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,251
when I found myself staring
at late book fees,

54
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,787
employee names, member addresses.

55
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,594
Everything was revealed.

56
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,963
The secret of the perfect hack?

57
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:22,565
Make it infallible.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,834
Hidden within the
kernel is a logic bomb,

59
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,669
malicious code designed to execute

60
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,971
under circumstances I've programmed.

61
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,807
Should the FBI take an
image of the femtocell,

62
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,010
all memory will
self-corrupt, or "explode."

63
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,012
Step four: Write the script.

64
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,681
Why do it myself?

65
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:40,516
Because that's how I learned, and I know

66
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:43,185
exactly what, when, and
how it's going to run.

67
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,788
I didn't do anything
harmful my first time.

68
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,156
Just looked around.

69
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:48,858
But I felt so powerful.

70
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,127
11 years old and in complete control

71
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,696
of the Washington
Township Public Library.

72
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,331
Today is different.

73
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,799
I hacked the world.

74
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,668
Final step: launch the attack.

75
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,770
Once I do, I'll own the Android phone

76
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,206
of every FBI agent in that building.

77
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll own Evil Corp's network,
applications, everything.

78
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,612
Domain Admin.

79
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,148
This, the thrill of pwning a system,

80
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:13,816
this is the greatest rush.

81
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,050
God access.

82
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,486
The feeling never gets old.

83
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:33,502
I'm gonna need to talk
to the old sys admin.

84
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,643
The old IT guy,

85
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,212
set this up.

86
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,481
There's an encrypted
database on the old server

87
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,383
I'm gonna need access to.

88
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,386
You wanna talk to RT?

89
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,355
If that's his name.

90
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,391
I'll talk to Ray,

91
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,959
see what's what.

92
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,749
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

93
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,900
Jeez Louise, look at that.

94
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,821
What the hell are you doing here?

95
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,022
How did you get in?

96
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:09,491
Penetration test. You failed.

97
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:12,294
I'm done anyway.

98
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,196
What is this?

99
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,831
I haven't seen you in five weeks

100
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,599
and now you're just in my home?

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,705
Leave. Now.

102
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,408
Okay, if you want the FBI to
find out you were the one

103
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,711
who illegally put a CD
into a drive at Allsafe

104
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,913
that set off the crime
of the millennium,

105
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,881
be my guest.

106
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,251
- He told you?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,987
And he cleared Allsafe's
logs to cover your ass,

108
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,724
but now with the FBI's
Five/Nine investigation,

109
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,126
this could all lead back
to both you and Elliot.

110
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:47,896
Why didn't he say anything?

111
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:49,998
Because that's what he does,

112
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,301
and now it's time for you to help him.

113
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,375
What exactly do you want from me?

114
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:17,393
Before I tell you,

115
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:20,963
I need you to keep reminding
yourself that this is simple.

116
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,600
Your gut instinct is gonna be
screaming a big fucking no,

117
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:27,236
and I need you to suppress that instinct

118
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:31,206
and remind yourself that this is simple.

119
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,243
If this little preface was
supposed to inspire confidence,

120
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,411
you're failing miserably.

121
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,712
I'll give you a small device,

122
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,147
which you'll take to work,

123
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,082
drop at the Fed's office
on the 23rd floor,

124
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,884
and walk away.

125
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,385
Simple.

126
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:47,756
Here it comes,

127
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,292
that gut instinct I was talking about.

128
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,094
Are you out of your mind?

129
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,833
You want me to hack the FBI?

130
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,469
What possible good would that even do?

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,771
Once we have access to their system,

132
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,307
we can make all of the bullshit go away.

133
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:08,010
Any evidence they have
on you and Elliot,

134
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,978
gone.

135
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:13,449
I'll take my chances.

136
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,192
Fine, play it how you wanna play it,

137
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,627
but I hope for Elliot and your sake,

138
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:28,030
no one else knows about that CD.

139
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:47,483
This is not our usual
time nor place to meet.

140
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,751
It was very risky for me to come here.

141
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,189
Talk to me. What's happened?

142
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,461
I don't wanna do this anymore.

143
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,330
I lied to the FBI,

144
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,664
and they know it.

145
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,866
They're not stupid.

146
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,300
They saw me sweat.

147
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,835
Now my phone is tapped.

148
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,071
Anytime I make phone calls,

149
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,540
I hear interference, voices.

150
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,016
I mean, who are we protecting?

151
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,718
Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?

152
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,756
Part of our agreement was

153
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,992
that you would not ask any questions.

154
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,361
You're right. You're right.

155
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,763
I just...

156
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,565
I know someone is watching me.

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
I can tell.

158
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:41,570
On the train, at work, in my apartment.

159
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,171
How do you know?

160
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,340
I just do.

161
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,576
I feel it, you know?

162
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,421
Thank you

163
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,223
for sharing this with me.

164
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,992
I promise you everything will be okay.

165
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,972
Hello, sir. You can't be here.

166
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,307
- I work here.
- Not on this floor.

167
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,976
Can you help this guy out?

168
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,578
We really need to close off
this elevator on-beau.

169
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:40,589
Firefighters are already
battling fierce blazes...

170
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,765
I hate coming here. Security's so lax.

171
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm still in the middle
of this deep dive

172
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,203
on the hard drive reports that
came back from Forensics.

173
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,776
I had that dream again.

174
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,580
Except this time, I was
walking down a steep hill,

175
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:06,115
and at the bottom was that same man

176
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,583
wearing a surgical mask.

177
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,786
He never tries to kill you?

178
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,656
Nope. Just staring.

179
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,028
You really don't dream, do you?

180
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:22,197
Never interested me.

181
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,433
You read Santiago's email?

182
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,270
Let me guess: you're excited.

183
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,506
Fuck yeah, I'm excited.
We get to go to China.

184
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,176
Yeah, well, just so you know,
I throw up on planes, so...

185
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,111
bring a raincoat and nose plugs.

186
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:40,149
Any updates on her?

187
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,850
Surveillance said she mostly stayed home

188
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:43,986
and then went to a yoga class.

189
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,221
Then they lost her again.

190
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,191
I'm telling you, it's hard
to track people in New York.

191
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,367
Where's the she-devil?

192
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:03,906
Don't know.

193
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,341
Something's wrong.

194
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,309
Darlene's never quiet unless...

195
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,011
Did the malware not check out?

196
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:12,514
It's Angela.

197
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,318
You need to talk to her.

198
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:18,220
About what?

199
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:21,757
With the FBI at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

200
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,159
We don't have time to prep a
new social engineering attack,

201
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,995
- so I went to her...
- She can't be involved.

202
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,564
What the hell else do you want me to do?

203
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,566
I am telling you, it's a fortress.

204
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,201
There's no way in there right now,

205
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,269
and it's as if we have
a lot of time to wait.

206
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,605
- Darlene's right.
- I'm not doing it.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,407
Who better than someone you trust?

208
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,009
I'm not discussing Angela with you.

209
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,244
She's our only option.

210
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,679
She's not an option.

211
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,614
Think of something else.

212
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,383
I did my part.

213
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,218
Now you do yours.

214
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:55,257
Make this happen.

215
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,620
Minister Zhang, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

216
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,989
The pleasure is mine, Mr. Santiago.

217
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,224
Welcome to China.

218
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,194
Oh, here.

219
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:15,938
Let's retire into the forum,
where we can talk in private.

220
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,342
As you'll see in your escorted tour

221
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,177
of Beijing's backup facility,

222
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,179
our attack was not climate control

223
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:25,547
like your raspberry pi.

224
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,649
Our backup tapes were degaussed.

225
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,017
We'd like to visit

226
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,653
all four of China's backup sites.

227
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:32,888
Of course.

228
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:34,156
And be granted access

229
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:37,359
to the encrypted E Corp servers.

230
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,994
Absolutely.

231
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,731
Excellent.

232
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,734
Now...

233
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,670
there is another subject to discuss.

234
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,375
We understand it is a delicate subject.

235
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,810
The Dark Army?

236
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,114
We'd like to review all
intelligence you have on them.

237
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,763
It's just that...

238
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:17,366
some of us think that, you know,

239
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:20,269
they as a... as a known
malevolent hacker group

240
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:21,304
might have...

241
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,671
Of course.

242
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:23,839
We'll get you all of our dossiers

243
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:26,608
with any intel we might have.

244
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:28,610
You're schedule to visit
our Beijing facility

245
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,546
on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

246
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,715
Enjoy yourselves. Take in the city.

247
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,585
Monday night, I wish to
host you at my home.

248
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,788
A reception to celebrate our...

249
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,857
collaborative effort.

250
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,524
You can't just do it yourself?

251
00:17:15,787 --> 00:17:18,788
No, not without access to the database.

252
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,290
But you're the best.

253
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,894
The master.

254
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,228
Ain't that true?

255
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,399
You gotta understand.

256
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,501
I hesitate because RT
and I didn't part ways

257
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:35,237
on the best of terms.

258
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,840
Yeah, come on!

259
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,543
I wouldn't ask if there
were another way.

260
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,846
You're wasting time, time we don't have.

261
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,749
You need to call Angela.

262
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:49,351
Maxine, what's wrong, girl?

263
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:52,721
Shh, don't make me think the worst now.

264
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,493
Is she okay?

265
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,865
If you say you need him,

266
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,268
you must need him.

267
00:18:06,304 --> 00:18:09,004
I'll have RT stop by.

268
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,973
Son, y'all know y'all can't jump.

269
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,294
I tracked the last package

270
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,865
to the Midtown post office
it was mailed from.

271
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,200
However, there's no evidence
on the security footage

272
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:40,870
of anyone mailing it
from inside the station.

273
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,906
It was probably dropped in
a nearby collection box.

274
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:46,976
And I have a contact attempting
to trace the phone calls,

275
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,577
but he needs more time.

276
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,613
I'll keep you updated as always.

277
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,483
Good night, ma'am.

278
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,118
And Kareem?

279
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,425
I did as you asked.

280
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,204
Framed burglary.

281
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:17,406
Cops'll likely go after

282
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:19,408
an ex-con who lives on the same floor.

283
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:23,045
MO matches other B&Es
the guy's suspected of.

284
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:41,530
Tell me...

285
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:42,698
tell me about his death.

286
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,038
Succinylcholine.

287
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:52,574
Injected as ordered.

288
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,977
And he didn't feel anything?

289
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:58,781
He was completely paralyzed.

290
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,994
It'll appear there was a struggle.

291
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:14,163
He pulled his gun in self-defense.

292
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,231
The attacker got him first.

293
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,000
Two gunshot wounds: one to the chest...

294
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:20,269
Another to the head.

295
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,471
Did he look at you

296
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:25,441
before you finished the job?

297
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,609
Yes.

298
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,912
Ma'am, if I may,

299
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,914
why drug him?

300
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:35,317
It would have been just as
easy to shoot and leave.

301
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:38,587
Killing a man instantly

302
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,623
robs him of explanation.

303
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:45,527
He has no time to process
his final moments.

304
00:20:45,563 --> 00:20:47,997
Now, even though he was paralyzed,

305
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:50,632
his mind was still able to understand

306
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,634
why his life was ending.

307
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:57,139
We let him die with answers.

308
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,744
Otherwise...

309
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,481
We're nothing but ruthless murderers.

310
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,856
Thank you.

311
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:58,067
- Hey.
- Hi.

312
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,070
I gotta say, I never thought

313
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:03,172
I'd ever hear from you again.

314
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:05,174
I ordered you a Bud Light.

315
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:07,543
Thanks.

316
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,278
You know, I'm...

317
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:11,447
I'm glad we're sitting here again.

318
00:22:11,482 --> 00:22:13,382
Our old spot.

319
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,084
You know,

320
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,852
booth over there by the window.

321
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,454
Remember?

322
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:20,422
It's where I first said
the three magic words.

323
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,093
Yeah, no, I don't think I remember that.

324
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:27,396
"I... love... you."

325
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:32,701
I-I meant it too.

326
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,172
I-I miss you, Angela.

327
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:39,608
Thanks.

328
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:42,211
Yeah, a lot of... lot of...

329
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,279
lot of good memories.

330
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:47,049
And look, Josh Groban night.

331
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:50,085
It's like we're, uh,

332
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:52,588
reliving our glory days.

333
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:55,090
But, uh, you, wow.

334
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,726
I mean, I hear things are
going great with you.

335
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:59,661
I hope this is cool

336
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:01,396
and not, like, weird,

337
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:03,298
but, um, I brought my résumé,

338
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,068
if you can... if you can do anything.

339
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:10,906
Well, I just figured, hey,

340
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:13,208
if there are any open positions...

341
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:19,815
I'll see what I can do.

342
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,084
So tell me.

343
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,520
How's life over there?

344
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:27,122
Very different than Allsafe.

345
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:28,824
You miss it?

346
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,392
Yeah.

347
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,330
And Gideon.

348
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:37,666
Crazy sad.

349
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,968
You know, I heard the
dude that shot him was,

350
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,703
like, off his rocker.

351
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,273
One of those, uh, Five/Nine truthers.

352
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,208
Some people even say that
the whole thing was,

353
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:48,277
uh, like, a put-on.

354
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:49,945
Like a... like one of those,

355
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,981
uh, crisis performances or whatever.

356
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,317
You know... you know,
those Frank Cody types.

357
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,786
Anyways, tragic for sure.

358
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,691
So you ever think that CD
had anything to do with it?

359
00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:15,804
Excuse me?

360
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,506
I'm just saying, like,

361
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,009
Allsafe was... was ground zero.

362
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:27,950
What the fuck?

363
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,857
Are you working with the FBI?

364
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,927
No, it's...

365
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,729
My uncle is a lawyer.

366
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:43,065
He told me to be careful and
record any suspicious...

367
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,666
- It's my uncle's fault.
- What the fuck?

368
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:47,436
What... oh, come on!

369
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,238
My contract was cleared
because of the hack.

370
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:50,572
I can't afford a new phone.

371
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:52,174
Answer me.

372
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:55,410
Honestly. Right now.

373
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:58,113
Did you talk to the FBI?

374
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,716
No.

375
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,751
Yes.

376
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,385
I me... I mean, Angela,

377
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,287
look, they called me
in, like, three times.

378
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:07,589
I can't sleep. I am scared as shit.

379
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,125
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

380
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,927
Just about the CD guy,
and then they did,

381
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,263
like, the sketch or whatever,
the facial composite thing,

382
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:17,099
but I swear, I never said your name.

383
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:18,367
Wait, where are you going?

384
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:19,635
Where...

385
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,224
This food is not sanitary, am I right?

386
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,159
I mean, where's the
General Tso's chicken?

387
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,128
I don't think that's a formal
hors d'oeuvre in China.

388
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,297
Yeah? I'm gonna ask.

389
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,800
This noodle bowl thing made me gag.

390
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:55,636
These people are savages.

391
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:19,426
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

392
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,194
Bathroom?

393
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,764
Um, toilet?

394
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,033
No English?

395
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:28,001
Okay, thank you.

396
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,043
Pardon me, do you have the time?

397
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,445
Oh, shit.

398
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:16,817
Mr. Zhang, I...

399
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:19,786
I was just admiring... looking at...

400
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:21,021
for the...

401
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,625
Oh, right, the time 'cause of the...

402
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,994
You've wandered very far from the party.

403
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,730
I was looking for the
little girls' room,

404
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,865
and then I... And this caught your eye?

405
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,105
Yeah, I...

406
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,673
I know it seems a little uncanny,

407
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,174
but my parents had the same clock

408
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,977
in our family room growing up.

409
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:47,080
I found this in Germany.
The town of Rothenburg.

410
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:48,682
Cost me a fortune.

411
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,951
The seller told me that
it was one of a kind.

412
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:54,621
So much for the honest salesman.

413
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:57,457
My parents bought theirs
at a Kmart in Teaneck.

414
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:01,094
Oh, is that where you're from?

415
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,430
- Miss...
- Jersey born and raised.

416
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:05,165
And my full name is Dominique DiPierro,

417
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
but I go by Dom.

418
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:08,268
Or Agent DiPierro.

419
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:10,470
Or just Dom.

420
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:15,809
So if I can ask,

421
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,210
what's the deal with the clocks?

422
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:21,181
Is it a punctuality thing?

423
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:24,351
"Life is but a walking shadow,

424
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:26,887
"a poor player that struts and frets

425
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,790
"his hour upon the stage

426
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:32,592
and then is heard no more."

427
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,463
You've surrounded yourself

428
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,299
with the constant reminder of mortality.

429
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:42,335
There's much work to do, great work.

430
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,071
As each second passes,

431
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,873
I push myself to keep moving.

432
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:49,643
You're making me think I should invest

433
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:50,977
in a decent watch.

434
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,750
Now, if I may ask,

435
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,351
how does a young woman from New Jersey

436
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:00,520
find her way into the FBI?

437
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,659
I was...

438
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:08,361
I am...

439
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:11,998
disgusted by the selfish
brutality of the world,

440
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:15,936
but at the same time, I'm
utterly fascinated by it.

441
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,905
The FBI's a perfect place for
that kind of contradiction.

442
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,478
I have something in my office
I think you might appreciate.

443
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,517
The artist strives to reflect
the desolation and anxiety

444
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:34,087
that accompanies one's loss of identity.

445
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:37,724
His message is subversive
to many in our country.

446
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,228
Nevertheless, the work
appeals to the masses

447
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,396
and to the individual.

448
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:47,200
How is it that revolution can
create such beautiful art

449
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:48,902
yet you and I are
tracking revolutionaries

450
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:51,371
who've created nothing but turmoil?

451
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:57,277
There's more to the story.

452
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:58,712
I'm sorry?

453
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,213
FBI.

454
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:02,182
Why you joined.

455
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,287
What was it?

456
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:10,290
It's a little personal.

457
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:12,893
That's precisely why I'm asking.

458
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:16,563
Oh.

459
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,268
Okay.

460
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,436
Um...

461
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,475
Well, it was a certain relationship.

462
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,646
A love story?

463
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:38,118
Of sorts. Sort of, sure.

464
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:40,020
Final semester of law school,

465
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,656
dating who I thought was the one,

466
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,990
at dinner,

467
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:47,494
days before graduation...

468
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,830
they got down on one
knee to propose, and...

469
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:58,038
This is gonna make me sound wacky,

470
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,307
but I...

471
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,410
excused myself to the restroom
and went out the back, and...

472
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,782
That was that.

473
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,817
Fast-forward several
years, I turn around,

474
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:13,787
and here's what I picked instead.

475
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:16,189
A mid-level field agent.

476
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:24,798
- What is it?
- I just...

477
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,701
Uh, I never would have...

478
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:31,004
expected to be talking
about an old flame

479
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,740
to China's minister of state security.

480
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,509
Ah.

481
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,311
It'll make a good story at Thanksgiving.

482
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,679
My dad'll love it.

483
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,193
Whose room is this?

484
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,869
Wow.

485
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:05,205
These are gorgeous.

486
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,007
A magua,

487
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:10,577
the common Manchu clothing
of the Qing Dynasty.

488
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,045
Detailed embroidery such as this

489
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,414
was often reserved for
the royal families.

490
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,718
This is a modern qípáo

491
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:20,587
by Jin Zhi Yu Ye.

492
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:22,088
Purchased in Shanghai.

493
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,925
The silk fabric and embroidered
lace are unrivaled.

494
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,326
Here.

495
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,933
Wow.

496
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:38,405
I've never touched
something so beautiful.

497
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,374
I feel the same way each time.

498
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:47,414
Where did these come from?

499
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:49,616
They belong to my sister.

500
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:52,585
She stays here when she's
passing through Beijing.

501
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:02,462
Let me ask, Miss DiPierro,

502
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:05,832
have you ever wondered
how the world would look

503
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,169
if the Five/Nine hack never happened?

504
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:12,639
How the world would look right now?

505
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:16,076
In fact, some believe there
are alternate realities

506
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:19,079
playing out that very scenario,

507
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,581
with other lives that we're leading...

508
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,185
Other people

509
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,987
that we've become.

510
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:37,464
The contemplation moves me very deeply.

511
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,941
Wow, you weren't kidding.

512
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:49,976
You really do have a thing...

513
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:51,778
I apologize, I must go.

514
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:53,780
May I escort you back to the party?

515
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:25,145
Why are you here?

516
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,113
Because I wanna be.

517
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:31,051
I told Darlene I didn't
want you involved.

518
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:33,486
She was right to involve me.

519
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:36,589
Please don't do this.
I'll find another way.

520
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,092
Darlene said it's a simple job.

521
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:43,596
I place the device on the
floor and walk away.

522
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,532
Then you guys will make
everything go away,

523
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:46,766
any evidence that you find.

524
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:48,635
That's true, right?

525
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:53,206
- Right?
- That's our plan.

526
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,741
But that's not the point.

527
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,676
Don't put yourself at risk.

528
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,445
I've run through my options.

529
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,180
Best-case scenario: I lose my job

530
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:02,382
and plea-bargain down a jail sentence.

531
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,451
I'm backed into a corner.

532
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:07,320
Either I act, or I wait to get caught.

533
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:14,027
I told myself that I would
wait to decide until I saw you

534
00:35:14,062 --> 00:35:15,962
because you wouldn't
let me walk into this

535
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,598
unless you were sure that
you could pull it off.

536
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,339
I've decided.

537
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:36,516
I miss you. You know that, right?

538
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:41,254
I reached out to you so many times,

539
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,324
and you kept saying no.

540
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,426
Can I just know why?

541
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:52,632
I keep thinking about that day

542
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,401
on the train platform.

543
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:57,971
After you found me in the cemetery.

544
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:03,776
You told me to take care of myself.

545
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:05,912
I wanted to be okay.

546
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,851
I wanted to s-stop seeing him

547
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:14,654
before I talked to you again.

548
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:18,625
And?

549
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,935
And my dead father's standing
behind you right now.

550
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,619
I can be a friend.

551
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,691
Someone to talk to.

552
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,127
Someone who cares about you.

553
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:58,698
Who knows? Maybe that will help.

554
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,206
How's Qwerty?

555
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,808
He's good.

556
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:13,213
He's fat.

557
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,481
I think I'm feeding him too much.

558
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:22,396
This is the federal bailout.

559
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:23,794
All right, this is
critical, and you're just

560
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,193
backing out of our biggest operation?

561
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,621
This isn't open for debate.

562
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:30,447
I can't go, and it's none of
your goddamn business why.

563
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:37,754
I want you to lead the D.C. op.

564
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:39,371
You're being promoted.

565
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:41,263
Take the crew down to
the Capitol tonight

566
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,698
and begin prepping.

567
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:44,099
You serious? Really?

568
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:46,201
Well, you've done good.

569
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:48,937
Now take charge. Act like a leader.

570
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:52,274
This is a very serious opportunity.

571
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,476
- You know the plan, right?
- Oh, yeah.

572
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,511
Good. Don't forget the package.

573
00:37:58,182 --> 00:37:59,614
I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

574
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,049
I'm not gonna let you down.

575
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:02,784
All right, I'm gonna do you proud.

576
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,686
- And they're gonna remember fso...
- Okay, just do your job

577
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:05,954
and stop acting like such a pussy.

578
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,456
I gotta take this.

579
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,660
Hello?

580
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:15,931
When?

581
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:23,972
There's an encrypted users database

582
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:26,341
in the marketplace directory.

583
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:29,144
Here, um, just...

584
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,380
let me drive.

585
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,555
You gonna ask or just stare?

586
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:44,126
Okay, what happened?

587
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,064
It was a rhetorical question.

588
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,999
Just stare.

589
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:57,439
This guy obviously knows his shit.

590
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,342
Why did Ray come to me?

591
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:17,893
Then you'll, um...

592
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:21,530
transfer the archives
to the local machine.

593
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:37,646
And then transfer the existing site

594
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,047
from the local machine

595
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,751
to the new server.

596
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:56,206
_

597
00:40:02,324 --> 00:40:08,074
_

598
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:20,761
_

599
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,121
_

600
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:34,570
You don't know when to stop.

601
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:38,107
This is what you wanted, remember?

602
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:40,075
Me, here at a terminal.

603
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:23,318
Good to go.

604
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:25,154
Uh, check on it if you need to.

605
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:35,597
Everyone has their own

606
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:37,666
if/then conditional programming,

607
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:40,469
a situation where if certain
conditions are met,

608
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:42,604
then a logic bomb detonates.

609
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,641
Everything blows up in your face.

610
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:49,578
Is this Ray's if/then moment or my own?

611
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:31,453
If Ray is running the site himself,

612
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,455
why bring me in?

613
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:35,624
Maybe he doesn't know the
evil that he's spreading.

614
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:38,293
Maybe he has no idea what's on the site.

615
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:40,796
Ray is protective, kind.

616
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:43,465
Ray is dangerous, a criminal.

617
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,367
Are those his two halves?

618
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,135
Which side of him is stronger?

619
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:49,338
Is he sinister enough to host the...

620
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:52,341
Stop figuring this out.

621
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:54,843
I wanna know.

622
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,813
You know.

623
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:00,382
But you're going to ignore it.

624
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:02,551
You wanna know why?

625
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:04,653
Because that's what we do.

626
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,957
It's not what I do.

627
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:13,195
If he's guilty,

628
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,930
I could destroy him

629
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:17,032
in under two minutes at a terminal.

630
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:19,401
Are we really back to this again?

631
00:43:19,436 --> 00:43:22,271
Ray is not some coffee shop owner.

632
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:26,074
Forget what you saw and move on.

633
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:31,580
You're thinking only of yourself.

634
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,782
I'm thinking of us.

635
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:39,755
And I'm thinking of the
people in those pictures.

636
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:47,162
I could help them.

637
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:54,002
We have other battles to fight.

638
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,577
What else is new?

639
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,320
A logic bomb explodes
either at a set time

640
00:44:11,355 --> 00:44:13,622
or when a specific condition is met.

641
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:16,592
And now I've met Ray's
black market of evil.

642
00:44:16,627 --> 00:44:18,927
Mr. Robot can deny it all he wants,

643
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:20,896
but I can't.

644
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,731
Can you?

645
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:38,480
Hello?

646
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:43,759
_

647
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,518
_

648
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:50,592
Tyrell...

649
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:53,177
_

650
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:58,754
Were you followed?

651
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,723
No, I don't think so.

652
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:03,592
Did you take the route I sent you?

653
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:05,460
Yeah.

654
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:07,496
Where's your cell phone?

655
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:09,564
At home.

656
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,566
No bullshit from here on.

657
00:47:11,602 --> 00:47:13,335
Understand?

658
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,761
Oh, my head is pounding.

659
00:47:39,797 --> 00:47:41,830
Way too much of that
Baijiu drink last night.

660
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:44,800
Speaking of, where'd you go?

661
00:47:44,835 --> 00:47:47,803
I got stuck listening to Jesse
trying to speak Chinese.

662
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:49,871
He made a lot of people
really uncomfortable.

663
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:51,973
Oh, you know, your average evening.

664
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:54,309
A private tour from
Minister Zhang himself.

665
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:55,610
What?

666
00:47:55,646 --> 00:47:58,046
Was he putting, uh, moves on you?

667
00:47:58,081 --> 00:47:59,848
No, not like that.

668
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:02,484
But he did take me to
his sister's bedroom

669
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,820
and show me her clothes.

670
00:48:04,855 --> 00:48:06,488
- That's sort of weird.
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:07,956
Even more so when you consider

672
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:10,192
Minister Zhang doesn't have a sister.

673
00:48:10,227 --> 00:48:13,395
Nice look, Hollywood.

674
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,996
Thanks. I got myself all gussied up

675
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:16,865
for the field trip.

676
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,201
- Where's Santiago?
- On another rampage.

677
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:21,236
ADIC called with updates
about the raspberry pi.

678
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:22,737
- Great.
- Not great.

679
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:24,206
Turns out the guy who found it

680
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:25,907
smudged his fat fingers all over it,

681
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:27,542
smearing any possible prints.

682
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:29,177
Another dead end.

683
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:31,046
When Santiago stomped
off, he was threatening

684
00:48:31,081 --> 00:48:33,181
to reach through his cell
phone and castrate the guy.

685
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:35,383
Fantastic.

686
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:36,918
Think I'm gonna need more caffeine

687
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:38,887
to survive the day.

688
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:56,204
Get them kids out of there!

689
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:35,810
Hey! Hey!

690
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:38,113
Hey! Help!

691
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:40,548
Ah!

692
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:43,218
Stop! Help!

693
00:49:43,253 --> 00:49:45,153
Help!

694
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:49,424
Fuck.

695
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:56,932
You are one stupid fucker.

696
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,902
Never trust a guy with a rattail.

697
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:02,837
Too easy to carve secrets out of.

698
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:19,821
Ray...

699
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:22,123
what are you doing?

700
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,526
I told you not to look.

701
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,487
