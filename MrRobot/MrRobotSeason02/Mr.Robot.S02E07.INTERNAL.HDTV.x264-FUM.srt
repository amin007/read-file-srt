1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:03,950
It's almost as if
something's come alive.

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:06,047
My perfectly constructed loop.

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:08,683
At 8:00 a.m. breakfast
with my friend Leon.

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,918
At 2:00 p.m. we'll check
out a basketball game.

5
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:13,087
Two days a week I go to a church group.

6
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:14,522
You could use some practice.

7
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:15,890
If he's guilty,

8
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:18,059
I could destroy him at a terminal.

9
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,127
I told you not to look.

10
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:21,429
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, pumpkin.

11
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,064
You were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail,

12
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,298
and it was raining

13
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,866
when you decided my mother would die?

14
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,201
If you want to change things,

15
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,904
perhaps you should try from within.

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,906
You want me to convince the class

17
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,607
to remove the contingency.

18
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:35,977
You're gonna give me exactly
what I want in return.

19
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:37,122
I can't wipe the security footage

20
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,223
of you planting the femtocell.

21
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,947
Angela Moss.

22
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,248
You won't be able to give me

23
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:42,683
anything I want out of life.

24
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,540
Oh, I think so.

25
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,475
Oh, oh, Tyrell, Joanna,

26
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,644
meet my silent partner in crime,

27
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,012
Sharon Knowles.

28
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:46,514
I've heard many good things.

29
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,849
- And her husband, Scott.
- How are things?

30
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,018
Tyrell here is our new rising young star

31
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:52,453
with an eye on the CTO position.

32
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,854
But he's gonna have to wait

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,556
for Terry Colby's golf
career to take off

34
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,124
or for an early stroke.

35
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,963
Those earrings are stunning.

36
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,665
Thank you.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,002
Tyrell's always surprising
me with little gifts.

38
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,688
Capitalistic pig!

39
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,729

40
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,444
Hello.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,279
I see you.

42
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,348
I recognize you.

43
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,218
I acknowledge your existence.

44
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,053
Let's talk.

45
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,608
Get to know who each other really are.

46
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,957
All of this is said with

47
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,558
a simple act of a handshake

48
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:06,393
between two people.

49
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,195
It's not any different than a client

50
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,598
connecting with a server.

51
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,100
It all relies on that first handshake

52
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,102
and naturally grows from there

53
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:18,139
for most people.

54
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,908
For me,

55
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:24,278
I can't seem to learn the rules.

56
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,252
What happened back there?

57
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,655
When you protected me.

58
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,626
What was that? I've
never seen that before.

59
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:41,262
That was what you needed.

60
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:50,905
Why were you trying to hide him?

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,007
- What are you talking about?
- Tyrell.

62
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,846
You were acting like he
wasn't in the trunk.

63
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,614
But Tyrell was there.

64
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,817
I saw him.

65
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:05,819
I thought we moved past this.

66
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,922
Let's not go backwards.

67
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,593
What are you so afraid will happen

68
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,761
if you tell me the truth?

69
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,275
Why do you want to know so bad?

70
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,366
Why do you even fucking care?

71
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:23,370
I don't want to be in denial anymore.

72
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:27,408
I just want to accept what I did...
and move on.

73
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,346
Fine.

74
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:35,382
I'll tell you.

75
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:48,562
What's the last thing that you remember?

76
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,901
Pop... popcorn.

77
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:57,738
I-I remember the popcorn.

78
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,678
Who the fuck?

79
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:10,884
I'm sorry, would you mind
holding for a moment?

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,886
Thanks.

81
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,755
I'll make this quick.

82
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,324
I'm Agent DiPierro, FBI
Cybercrime Division.

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,159
We co-opted one of your floors.

84
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,995
I was heading to my station when

85
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,863
I see you.

86
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,566
And it wasn't an "oops, wrong
floor" kind of drop-in.

87
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,269
From where I was, it looked like
you were coming from somewhere.

88
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:31,205
Now, this is nothing official
so don't worry, but...

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,506
I just had to ask,

90
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,242
what were you doing on
a restricted floor?

91
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,380
Making plans

92
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:41,882
with Agent Thomas.

93
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,218
We were trying to decide
drinks tomorrow or

94
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:47,187
lunch today.

95
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,623
Where'd you land?

96
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,959
Lunch.

97
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:53,594
A Greek place nearby.

98
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,399
How do you know each other?

99
00:05:58,434 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm sorry, is there something else

100
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,969
I can help you with?

101
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:03,637
I just

102
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:06,974
really have to get back to
this call before lunch.

103
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:10,978
You know, this is the honest,

104
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:14,982
"cards on the table" truth,

105
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:18,652
your story fascinates me.

106
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,721
The luck...

107
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,225
To leave Allsafe a week before
the company gets hacked

108
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,128
and then to end up here at E Corp.

109
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,398
It's ironic given your history.

110
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,667
Okay, don't freak. She's got nothing.

111
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,270
If she did, you'd already be busted.

112
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:37,504
Well, I should quit babbling.

113
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,573
I was gonna have you
drop by soon anyway.

114
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,242
Drop by?

115
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:43,911
For what?

116
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,448
Just to get a statement, answer
a few questions, no big.

117
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,616
I'd be happy to.

118
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,819
I'm just really busy right now.

119
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,762
Whatever this is...

120
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:08,802
It's not you.

121
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,541
Okay, final command,

122
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:15,542
ifconfig,

123
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,610
space,

124
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,681
wlan1, space, up.

125
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:30,324
And there it is.

126
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,726
What?

127
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,629
We just owned the FBI.

128
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,415
I did it, didn't I?

129
00:07:55,584 --> 00:08:00,320
It was either us

130
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,556
or him.

131
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:17,471
How did I do it?

132
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:21,909
Elliot...

133
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:25,012
the guy was fucking batshit.

134
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,714
He was raving about

135
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,616
killing some woman and...

136
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,785
the wonder of it all.

137
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:34,388
I mean, we were gonna be next.

138
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:37,424
How did I do it?

139
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:42,463
After I ran the scripts,

140
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,399
he went off on us being gods.

141
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,471
The popcorn,

142
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:54,074
that's where Darlene
said she hid that gun.

143
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:58,412
And I didn't want to, but...

144
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:05,752
I shot him.

145
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,089
No.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,660
I shot him.

147
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:23,437
Harder.

148
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,606
Harder.

149
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,113
Harder.

150
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,182
I told my friends you're coming.

151
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,020
You know that can't happen.

152
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:42,289
I thought this was our celebration.

153
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,691
We love each other. What's to hide?

154
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:48,095
Derek.

155
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,131
I mean, how many times
do you get to turn 30?

156
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,768
Either come to my party
tonight as my girlfriend

157
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,770
or we're done.

158
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,444
Pull up two hours ago.

159
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,290
Last week, any day.

160
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,306
The entire archive's corrupt.

161
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,875
Call the network team.

162
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,244
You guys just got hacked.

163
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,514
I'd sweep the 23rd floor and
check Angela Moss's computer.

164
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,894
You won't find anything... I'm
sure she erased all traces...

165
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,818
but check anyway.

166
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,853
Where you going?

167
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,355
It's Fourth of July tomorrow.

168
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,359
I'm gonna find a barbeque
to be miserable at.

169
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,587
Trash pile-ups have now become

170
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,344
a real epidemic in the city.

171
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,512
Due to the credit crisis
brought on by Five/Nine,

172
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,247
many private businesses cannot afford

173
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:15,849
waste management services,

174
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,517
which has sparked a cottage industry of

175
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,786
roadside garbage burning
at discounted rates.

176
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:21,688
The Taxi and Limousine
Commission asks that

177
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,690
drivers now accept Ecoin.

178
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,359
Per the Taxi and Limousine Commission,

179
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,628
payment can be made via mobile phone.

180
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:30,397
Just download the Ecoin
app from the Play Store

181
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,799
or App Store, scan the QR code

182
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,301
once you reach your destination,

183
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:35,614
and the payment will be withdrawn

184
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,304
from your Ecoin Wallet.

185
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:51,752
You had me worried, not
answering my calls

186
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:52,787
after all that went down.

187
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:53,787
I'm gonna go.

188
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:57,090
You weren't the target.

189
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:58,126
Cisco was just trying...

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,794
Stop.

191
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,931
I know you already put
the rest together, so...

192
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,934
no more smokescreens.

193
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,771
Okay, ask me anything, I'm an open book.

194
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:13,273
I owe you that.

195
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:17,344
You guys always thought that
you were smarter than me.

196
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,280
But come on.

197
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:24,117
You never actually hid it that well.

198
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:25,952
Every Halloween,

199
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:28,455
when we were kids,

200
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,425
you and Elliot always made me
watch that shitty scary movie.

201
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,493
It was so bad.

202
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,128
And all these years later,

203
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:38,131
I'd kind of forgotten about it.

204
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:42,602
Even when the masks started
popping up in those videos.

205
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,938
I didn't place it at first.

206
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,176
Maybe I did.

207
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,846
Maybe I didn't want to.

208
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,948
I mean, come on,

209
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,952
that's crazy, right?

210
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,122
That you guys would...

211
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,364
Had enough alone time down there

212
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,024
to get your head right and
do what needs to be done?

213
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,016
Speak up.

214
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,340
Yeah.

215
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,279
You believe him?

216
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,056
Yeah.

217
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,499
Okay.

218
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,802
This is how it's gonna go.

219
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:20,615
You gonna sit your ass right here

220
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,784
until you do what you got to do.

221
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,287
Once the site's up,

222
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:29,690
you gonna crawl back into your hole

223
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:33,694
until we're sure this baby's
purring like a kitten.

224
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,991
How long is this gonna take?

225
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,927
A few hours.

226
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:07,328
Once he gets what he wants...

227
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,463
Right now he needs me.

228
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:12,667
So that makes us safe.

229
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,276
What's with the looks?

230
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,311
Mm.

231
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:10,891
And this is happening tomorrow?

232
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,127
Mm-hmm.

233
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,235
Hello, Derek.

234
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,905
You never showed up.

235
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,842
Told you what would happen
if you didn't show up.

236
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:31,345
No-no-no-no-no, that's
not gonna work anymore.

237
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,849
You've been messing with
me for way too long.

238
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:36,384
I should've known

239
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,253
somebody that I met working
at a stuck-up E Corp party

240
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:41,022
would be bad news.

241
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:44,058
Meeting you at that party
changed something for me.

242
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:47,895
I'd be lost right now without you.

243
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,597
What you want,

244
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,600
I want it too.

245
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:56,604
I was busy tonight because I was
hassling my lawyer on holiday

246
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,640
to do this.

247
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,213
It's my birthday gift to you.

248
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,625
Holy shit.

249
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,061
We're getting more traffic than ever.

250
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:23,097
Says our Bitcoin intake
doubled since we've been up.

251
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:28,135
200,000 we could have
made while we were down,

252
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,571
that's on you, boy.

253
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:34,542
It's time to go back to
your cage, shitbrick.

254
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:37,478
What about a game?

255
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:41,148
Old time's sake.

256
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,417
Give me and Elliot a minute.

257
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,453
Wait outside.

258
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:00,601
All right, set it up.

259
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:08,409
Thank you.

260
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:10,177
For what?

261
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:14,982
When we first met, I
thought I was helping you.

262
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,018
I thought I was gonna be your savior.

263
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,258
I didn't tell you about my wife.

264
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,727
She was so smart.

265
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:31,432
Way smarter than me.

266
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,434
She was like you,

267
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,603
real good with computers.

268
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:38,005
That's what she did for a living.

269
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,442
So when she had this idea to do a site,

270
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:44,845
it sounded good to me.

271
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:50,151
I don't think she ever meant
it to go where it went.

272
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:53,854
She was wanting to make
some extra scratch.

273
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,023
But the thing grew so fast,

274
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:59,293
it took on a life of its own.

275
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:01,495
And the money,

276
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,364
well...

277
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,499
We're talking about the
type of money that

278
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,903
makes you question right and wrong.

279
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,137
So, you know,

280
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:12,039
we made a deal.

281
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:14,975
Decided we'd let the market dictate

282
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:17,645
what was sold on the site.

283
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
And we wouldn't look.

284
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,352
She was better at the denial than me.

285
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:26,654
It ate at me,

286
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,057
all the things I imagined were going on.

287
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,860
I feared the worst.

288
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,728
But I still didn't look.

289
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:39,333
Not until you came along.

290
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,345
After I found out what was on there,

291
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,947
what we did to you,

292
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:55,382
what we did to RT,

293
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:58,219
it was weak.

294
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:02,957
Way back when,

295
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,959
when I said it was about stumbling,

296
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,961
I was wrong.

297
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:17,271
I should've taken a fucking stand.

298
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:28,482
You are my answer.

299
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:35,389
It's not the other way around.

300
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:41,729
So thank you.

301
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:01,782
How much time do I have?

302
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,923
Come on, man.

303
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:11,992
We both knew exactly
what you were gonna do

304
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:15,095
when I let you go back on that computer.

305
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,532
With their response time,

306
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,368
I would guess they have
us surrounded by now.

307
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,717
You better get out before
they get up here then.

308
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:39,887
World champion chess
master Emanuel Lasker

309
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,221
once said,

310
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:45,459
"When you see a good move...

311
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:49,129
look for a better one."

312
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,973
Elliot.

313
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:08,515
Be careful.

314
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:24,231
I gave Ray the chance
to make the right move.

315
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:28,736
And he left himself wide open to me.

316
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:44,218
When I completed the migration,

317
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,920
I also took it upon
myself to open the site

318
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:50,557
to more than just TOR traffic.

319
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:52,693
Stay right here and don't move.

320
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:55,095
Just had to index it on
a few search engines

321
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:56,597
and with the added touch of adverts

322
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:58,799
on the top advertising sites,

323
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,435
and now it's accessible
to any average scumbag

324
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,438
that Googles "Thai girls for sale."

325
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:06,874
Didn't take long for the FBI to catch on

326
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:10,210
after I emailed them an anonymous tip.

327
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:14,815
Mr. Robot was a part of me that
I created because of my pain.

328
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,051
So now we have a chance to start again.

329
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,288
Our handshake negotiated us as partners.

330
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,992
The House will come to order.

331
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:42,236
There has been much mystery

332
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:44,538
surrounding the vandalism and castration

333
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,373
of the Wall Street bull.

334
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,875
That mystery was solved when

335
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,810
the missing anatomy of the bull

336
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,546
crashed through a skylight
of the House chamber.

337
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,849
Police, FBI, and the Department
of Homeland Security

338
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,651
have begun a full-fledged manhunt

339
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,654
for those parties responsible.

340
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,156
You haven't answered my
calls since the weekend.

341
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,893
As you can see, it's busy.

342
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,861
Ever since this bailout
fiasco yesterday,

343
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,030
these kits are flying off the shelves.

344
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,533
The, uh, end of civilization is near,

345
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,735
so this is gonna have to wait.

346
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,970
I can settle the lawsuit.

347
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,941
Stay out of that.

348
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,109
The lawyers are handling it.

349
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:23,911
E Corp will settle.

350
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:27,347
But there's a contingency with
the independent inspections.

351
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,615
If we drop it...

352
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:29,961
I'm not discussing this with you.

353
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,185
If you drop the independent inspections,

354
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,587
they will settle.

355
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:37,224
Did... did your boss put you up to this?

356
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:42,863
Look at what's happening.

357
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,965
Who knows if this company
will be around long enough

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,601
to see this case through?

359
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:50,270
Drop the contingency.
You'll get your money.

360
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,873
The inspections are there for a reason.

361
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,375
Do you want what happened to your mom

362
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,977
to happen again?

363
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,146
I'll make sure the inspections
go forward internally.

364
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:03,383
Is that how they're suckering you?

365
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,319
Trust me, they value me over there.

366
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,426
You laugh,

367
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:16,430
but they respect me.

368
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,333
I don't know who this person
is who's in front of me,

369
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:22,436
but I'm not agreeing to any of this.

370
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,972
I don't trust them.

371
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:27,274
And to be honest?

372
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,176
I don't trust you.

373
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:31,278
Besides, you think anyone
else is gonna want to

374
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,280
sign on to whatever you're selling?

375
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,248
It's not just my vote,

376
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,484
it's the whole class.

377
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,986
You need 2/3.

378
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:41,488
I already got the signatures.

379
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,294
That's the trick about money.

380
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:51,198
Banks care more about
it than anything else.

381
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,670
What exactly is in this for you?

382
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:59,539
You aren't getting the money. I am.

383
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:01,475
You know that, right?

384
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,343
So I'll ask you one more time.

385
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,312
Why did you come here?

386
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:09,082
Because you certainly didn't
give a shit about my opinion.

387
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,121
This was just a courtesy.

388
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,323
Two weeks and it's done.

389
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,774
Now this Ray thing got everyone talking.

390
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,917
I didn't have anything to do with that.

391
00:26:43,952 --> 00:26:47,220
Lying ain't your friend right now, cuz.

392
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:50,190
Everyone got their eyes on you.

393
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,328
Half of them love you.

394
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,432
Half of them want to kill you.

395
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:02,803
Other half just want
to twist your shit up.

396
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:05,672
But you know, it's that last half

397
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,575
I'm worried about for you, bro.

398
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,943
Hey.

399
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:13,113
Little man, book it real quick for me.

400
00:27:18,087 --> 00:27:20,220
I'm good here.

401
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,091
What's that?

402
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,758
Didn't hear you.

403
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,626
You heard.

404
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,270
Fucking

405
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:39,072
bravery

406
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:41,641
is contagious.

407
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,882
I suggest you talk to your boy.

408
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,318
He's fine where he is.

409
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,193
Ray's site.

410
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,763
I had 800 Bitcoins in my wallet.

411
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,132
Now, all of a sudden, I got no access.

412
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:02,885
Can't even make new sales
'cause the site's down.

413
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:06,032
All of this is on you.

414
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,393
So the way I see it,

415
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:11,337
you're paying me back.

416
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,406
We'll get some one-on-one

417
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,942
later on.

418
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:38,892
Just remember, cuz,

419
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:42,496
sitting under the Sword of Damocles.

420
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,835
Out of the blue,

421
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,338
I received a call from my lawyer.

422
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:54,674
Seems the contingency
on our biggest lawsuit

423
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,978
was miraculously dropped.

424
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:00,580
Care to explain?

425
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:03,450
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

426
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,818
I remember telling you

427
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:06,853
exactly the opposite.

428
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,523
You just didn't want to ask for it.

429
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,527
But it is what you wanted.

430
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:18,231
You gonna take the offer then?

431
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:23,670
Well, it's not for me to say,

432
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:26,373
officially, but...

433
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,542
despite the fact that
we're hemorrhaging money

434
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:30,210
at the moment,

435
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,878
settling this would
be a lot cheaper than

436
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:35,515
dealing with the legal expense.

437
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:38,018
Can I ask why it was
so important for you

438
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:40,887
to drop this contingency?

439
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:47,861
You protecting some

440
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:50,564
evil, secret agenda?

441
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:54,901
Aren't we all protecting our

442
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:57,204
evil, secret agendas?

443
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:05,045
In that case,

444
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,047
here's mine.

445
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:08,481
One of the things that Terry Colby

446
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,517
said to me when I took this job

447
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:14,254
was I could make changes from within.

448
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,091
I want my position moved

449
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:19,993
to the Risk Management Department.

450
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:21,995
There's a manager position available.

451
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,897
And even though I may
lack the experience,

452
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,099
I think you know I can
more than make up for it

453
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,267
with drive

454
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,835
and quick learning.

455
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,271
That's how you choose
to squander the capital

456
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:33,373
you've just earned...

457
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,242
You're aware that's a

458
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:36,443
lateral move?

459
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,411
It's what I want.

460
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,959
And I am asking.

461
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,570
It's my birthday today.

462
00:31:05,274 --> 00:31:08,575
Did you know that?

463
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,610
No.

464
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:11,878
Hm.

465
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,146
- I thought...
- No, no...

466
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,614
Don't believe what you read online.

467
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,650
Today

468
00:31:15,684 --> 00:31:19,452
is my actual birthday.

469
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,955
I never share the real one with anyone.

470
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,091
Some things I like to keep to myself.

471
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,432
Happy birthday then.

472
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:41,808
Would you like to

473
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,743
celebrate

474
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,446
with me?

475
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,715
Tonight?

476
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:55,555
No.

477
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,968
Well, maybe next year.

478
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,974
Wither thou goest to possess them

479
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,875
and thou succeedest them,

480
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:19,012
and dwellest in their land.

481
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:21,481
Amen.

482
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:23,850
Amen.

483
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:44,704
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

484
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,340
For my outburst last month.

485
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:59,085
Can you let go of me, please?

486
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,991
I know you're afraid,

487
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:08,161
but the fear you have is a right one.

488
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:12,332
It means you'll be forever vigilant.

489
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,567
You want to know how I know?

490
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,672
I've seen you talking to Him.

491
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,909
Not out loud, but I could tell.

492
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,046
It's written all over your face.

493
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:28,515
It's not crazy, Elliot,

494
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,419
it's very normal.

495
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:35,221
You've seen me talking to him?

496
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,956
Yes.

497
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:40,126
But you don't have to
keep it such a secret.

498
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:46,032
When you let Jesus into your heart,

499
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,902
He'll always listen.

500
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:56,242
Tell you what,

501
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:59,279
I'll give you some alone time.

502
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:37,350
I need your help.

503
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:42,622
I've been lost these past few weeks.

504
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:47,193
Since the whole Ray thing.

505
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:49,662
I need to finish what I started.

506
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,965
With Evil Corp.

507
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,100
But I don't know what to do.

508
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:11,084
Why did you first start listening to me?

509
00:35:14,356 --> 00:35:15,989
When I sent you that note

510
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:19,993
on the server at Evil Corp,

511
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:23,563
something inside you told you to listen.

512
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:26,566
And you did.

513
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,334
Followed me off the subway,

514
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,004
came to fsociety,

515
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,405
and then you...

516
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,740
not me...

517
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:37,844
led us to hack Evil Corp.

518
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,580
I didn't force you to do any of it.

519
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,215
It was all you.

520
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,217
Your choice.

521
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:46,419
Truth is,

522
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:49,455
I just followed your lead.

523
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:57,297
People want to follow you, son.

524
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,034
Why?

525
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:03,336
Same reason why you led the entire world

526
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,072
into a revolution.

527
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:09,509
Because you are a leader.

528
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,718
I don't want to be a leader.

529
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:20,887
You asked me how to finish this.

530
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:22,422
That's what you need to do.

531
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:25,458
You need to lead.

532
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:33,368
And not unlike your floor,

533
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:35,178
coffee machine, file room.

534
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:36,490
People in this bullpen, these are your

535
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,846
risk management coordinators,

536
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:39,314
you'll be working with this team.

537
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,483
Put out risk reports, analyses,

538
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,152
and you report everything out to me.

539
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:45,621
After Five/Nine, almost all of our time

540
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:49,158
is dedicated to helping
the crisis response team.

541
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:51,693
That's what we do here.

542
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:54,029
Our internal investigation team

543
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:56,065
make recommendations to management

544
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,000
about ways to

545
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:01,170
address the crisis and course correct.

546
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,072
Need you to be smart.

547
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:05,741
Think outside the box and be discreet.

548
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:07,476
You get in; you get out;

549
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:08,844
assess the situation quickly;

550
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,145
find answers;

551
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:14,249
figure out ways to limit damage.

552
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:16,318
I'm giving you access

553
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:18,520
to the case we're working on now.

554
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:21,824
It's a class action
lawsuit brewing in Flint

555
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,160
over water contamination.

556
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:27,029
Nothing public yet, but

557
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:28,064
could be big

558
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,998
first quarter, 2016.

559
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,834
Do I just go into the file server

560
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:32,835
to access that?

561
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,336
I'll have IT

562
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:35,671
run you through everything.

563
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,841
Setup, Outlook, Calendar.

564
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:43,212
You knew Gideon Goddard?

565
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,013
We worked together on a couple projects

566
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:46,448
when he was a vendor.

567
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:49,751
It's terrible what happened to him.

568
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:52,754
Well, why don't you go ahead
and get yourself up to speed?

569
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,424
I'll check in once a week.

570
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:59,027
Let me know if you need anything.

571
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,239
Can I sit in on the
daily debrief meeting?

572
00:38:10,274 --> 00:38:12,641
Look,

573
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:13,976
that's, uh,

574
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:15,744
that's a director-level meeting.

575
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:17,479
We don't really invite managers to that.

576
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:18,981
If I could just sit and listen

577
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:20,983
it might help me get up to speed faster.

578
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:22,651
I want to make sure I can add value

579
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:25,254
as soon as possible.

580
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,555
All right.

581
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,323
It's later this afternoon.

582
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,826
I'll send you an invite
with the details.

583
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,164
Did you get in

584
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,000
okay this morning with
these protestors out here?

585
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,138
It's crazy, right?

586
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:56,351
I was on a route to cure
myself of Mr. Robot.

587
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:59,588
The regiment was supposed
to be that path.

588
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:03,825
I never thought the
regiment would be the thing

589
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:06,662
that would lead me right
back where I started.

590
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,465
People always told me growing up that

591
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:12,668
it's never about the destination.

592
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:15,370
It's about the journey.

593
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:19,775
But what if the destination is you?

594
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,611
What if it's always you?

595
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,220
Hey!

596
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:32,454
Help!

597
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:39,027
I heard you got a problem.

598
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:40,796
You know what else your problem is?

599
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:41,863
Too much courage.

600
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:43,332
Just like your nigger friend.

601
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,477
He might tell you it's a good thing,

602
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:45,734
but it ain't always.

603
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,703
It makes you have errors in judgment.

604
00:39:49,006 --> 00:39:50,539
But I'm gonna do you a solid.

605
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:52,808
I'm gonna fix that courage
problem of yours.

606
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,580
Okay.

607
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:04,152
We should break that brave,
little soul of yours, homey.

608
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,101
You could've avoided this if
you'd just given me my money.

609
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,658
Think about that.

610
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:12,661
Think about it.

611
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:15,397
Think about it.

612
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:17,432
No, no!

613
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:39,121
Gonna get a letter on Tuesday.

614
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:41,423
Do what it says.

615
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:53,702
Hey, yo, man,

616
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:58,140
when you see Whiterose,

617
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,842
make sure you say I did you good.

618
00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:13,422
I'll be rooting for you, cuz.

619
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,825
Always.

620
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:34,842
Usually, they feed us.

621
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:35,843
It's one of the only reasons

622
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:37,044
to come to these meetings.

623
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,612
Should we go ahead and start?

624
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:40,380
It doesn't look like
Susan's gonna make it.

625
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,727
Is there any reason to have
this meeting without her?

626
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,351
The economy must really
be in the shitter

627
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:47,254
if Susan Jacobs finally decided
to take her vacation days.

628
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:49,022
First order of business

629
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:51,136
is the small independent loan
companies we're servicing.

630
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,370
I'm surprised they're not suing us

631
00:41:52,394 --> 00:41:53,794
for breach of the uptime clauses.

632
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:54,973
I have three class actions on

633
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:56,430
that point alone in my region.

634
00:41:56,465 --> 00:41:58,365
Contractual damage on
uptime are minimal.

635
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,478
I'm not even worried about it.

636
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:01,101
We'll settle.

637
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,403
But we should discuss those
when Susan comes back.

638
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:05,906
Maybe it would be helpful
if I put together a summary

639
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,042
of how we've... handled past cases.

640
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,555
To see if there are any
patterns that might

641
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:13,447
help us figure out how
to address this issue.

642
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,417
If we pull milestone cases

643
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,787
like Dakota Fracking and

644
00:42:19,822 --> 00:42:21,622
Washington Township,

645
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:24,591
I could put together a summary briefing.

646
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:30,497
All I would need is access to the files

647
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:33,033
and then I could get working
on that right away.

648
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:50,751
You know what?

649
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:53,687
There's not much we can do here today.

650
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:56,824
Food never came, Susan's out.

651
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:58,258
Let's adjourn.

652
00:42:58,294 --> 00:42:59,704
Didn't I just say that two minutes ago?

653
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:01,295
We're really leaving before the food?

654
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,363
I said adjourned.

655
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:22,783
I know who you are.

656
00:43:22,818 --> 00:43:23,951
You did what you did

657
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:25,652
to get a job here.

658
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:28,121
You sucked whoever's dick
to get transferred here.

659
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:30,724
And, frankly, I don't really care.

660
00:43:32,728 --> 00:43:35,996
This is a favor to Price.

661
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,865
You know what he told me,

662
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,434
when I asked him how I
should deal with you?

663
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:44,137
He said, and I quote,

664
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:47,174
"However you want."

665
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:59,052
Enjoy the shrimp cocktail.

666
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,957
This is good news, don't you think?

667
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:15,469
But you're not happy about it.

668
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:21,241
I'm not sure.

669
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:24,244
When did you get it?

670
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,613
This morning.

671
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:32,552
How are your interactions with him?

672
00:44:34,657 --> 00:44:36,256
For the first time,

673
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:39,293
we trust each other.

674
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:42,629
I help him, and he helps me.

675
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:45,766
Since I've been at my mom's,

676
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:48,969
I wanted to get rid of him.

677
00:44:49,004 --> 00:44:52,806
But you were right.

678
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:56,843
You can't destroy a part of yourself.

679
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:06,687
Elliot, I need to ask you a question.

680
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,525
Where do you think you are right now?

681
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,664
What do you mean?

682
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:26,306
Elliot,

683
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:30,477
you know you haven't been staying
with your mother, right?

684
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,080
I know.

685
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,099
When you get released,

686
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:56,269
I hope you continue
seeing me in my office.

687
00:45:56,305 --> 00:45:59,873
I think it's important we
maintain our regular schedule.

688
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:03,710
Don't you agree?

689
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:05,145
Yes.

690
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,684
Mr. Robot was right.

691
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,061
Control can sometimes be an illusion.

692
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:24,731
But sometimes you need
illusion to gain control.

693
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:36,576
Fantasy is an easy way to
give meaning to the world,

694
00:46:36,612 --> 00:46:40,747
to cloak our harsh reality
with escapist comfort.

695
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,985
After all,

696
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,089
isn't that why we surround
ourselves with so many screens?

697
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:53,326
So we can avoid seeing?

698
00:46:53,362 --> 00:46:55,062
So we can avoid each other?

699
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:56,863
I don't think I'm ready to

700
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:58,732
talk about it just yet.

701
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:01,568
So we can avoid truth?

702
00:47:03,605 --> 00:47:07,674
I'm sorry for not
telling you everything.

703
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:11,678
But I needed this in
order to get better.

704
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,717
Please don't be mad too long.

705
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:20,554
This will be the last time
I keep things from you.

706
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:23,190
I promise.

707
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:43,577
I know what you're thinking,

708
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:45,745
and no.

709
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,747
I didn't lie to you.

710
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:50,150
See you in the morning.

711
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,319
All of this really happened.

712
00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:54,321
This was just my way of coping with it.

713
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:56,123
But now, I'd like it if

714
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:59,593
we could trust each other again.

715
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,261
Let's shake on it.

716
00:48:02,286 --> 00:48:04,808
