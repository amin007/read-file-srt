1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,688
_

2
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:47,494
Anything?

3
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,663
Nothing yet.

4
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,419
Who is that? Who is that,
that guy on the bike?

5
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:47,788
He looks like he's coming
straight toward me.

6
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,156
Okay, he's closing in. We're coming.

7
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,390
- No, wait.
- It's too risky.

8
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,661
- We need to fly in.
- Wait.

9
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:59,900
Are you... from E Corp?

10
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:02,302
- Who are you?
- Just making a delivery.

11
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,304
Please sign here.

12
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,667
- What is this?
- Someone grab the biker.

13
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,202
- Grab the biker.
- No, no, no,

14
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:37,204
they haven't picked up the money yet.

15
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,284
Mr. Knowles, we don't recommend that.

16
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,286
We should have our unit search it first.

17
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,813
Sir, are you all right?

18
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,248
Should we come in? Are you all right?

19
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:27,387
Is that your phone?

20
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,022
You have ten seconds to do what it says,

21
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:33,026
or every Bank of E
system will be bricked.

22
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,899
Sir, who was the caller?

23
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,613
Mr. Knowles, what are you doing?

24
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:48,186
There's no way.

25
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:52,890
We've already committed $900 billion.

26
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,693
It would be irresponsible
if the feds sent more.

27
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,061
And we're not going
to ask the government

28
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,063
to pony up the cash.

29
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,499
How do you burn through
that kind of money

30
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,767
in 30 days anyway?

31
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:05,403
You have something right... right there.

32
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:08,006
Finally you're seeing my point.

33
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,876
No, no, on your face.

34
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,511
The point is, Phillip,

35
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,747
we've already given you our
burst of cash on hand.

36
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:17,348
We can't give you any more.

37
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,117
Well, we'll sell the
T-bills to the Chinese,

38
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:20,385
and that money in return

39
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,186
will be used as a loan for our company.

40
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:25,590
Look, the real recovery program
is months from being done.

41
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,692
The public is hoarding cash.

42
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,861
The housing market is
grinding to a halt.

43
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,230
The big three are on
the verge of collapse.

44
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,399
Everyone at the commission
needs to see results

45
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:35,933
within the next three weeks

46
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,102
before we can do anything else.

47
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,038
Look, rebuilding our database

48
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:42,407
is the only solution to this problem.

49
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,242
This is not my opinion.

50
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,077
These are the facts,
ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,880
Now, I've cooperated
with you on every level.

52
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,083
I even have the goddamn FBI
working out of my offices.

53
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:58,118
Janet, Mary, Jack, please.

54
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,624
Tell me you didn't ask me

55
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,259
to fly down all the way to D.C.

56
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,295
just so you could, what,
hear yourselves complain?

57
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,833
You've got to resign.

58
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,301
We have no other options.

59
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,769
The President can't go to Congress

60
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,805
with a bailout right now.

61
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,016
In the fallout of the Great Depression,

62
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:30,621
FDR closed all the banks
for a bank holiday,

63
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,858
and then he reopened them in stages

64
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:39,464
when they were reported to being sound.

65
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:43,601
Later, historians discovered
what we in this room now know,

66
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:48,272
that those reports,
they were mostly lies.

67
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:52,110
Nevertheless, it worked.

68
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,313
It worked because the public believed

69
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,749
the government had
everything under control.

70
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:04,355
You see, that is the business model

71
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,890
for this great nation of ours.

72
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,059
Every business day when
that market bell rings,

73
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:11,562
we con people into
believing in something,

74
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,633
the American dream, family values.

75
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,870
Could be freedom fries for all I care.

76
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,839
It doesn't matter

77
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,209
as long as the con works

78
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:29,580
and people buy and sell

79
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:32,617
whatever it is we want them to.

80
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:38,256
If I resign,

81
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:42,260
then any scrap of confidence

82
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:48,295
the public is already clinging
onto will be destroyed,

83
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:50,701
and we all know

84
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:54,872
a con doesn't work

85
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,909
without the confidence.

86
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:03,848
If this was the best idea

87
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:07,718
you could come up with for a win,

88
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:10,288
I shouldn't be the one resigning.

89
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,225
I have to head back to New York.

90
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,060
Let me know when you've
locked up the votes,

91
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:22,095
and wipe your goddamn mouth.

92
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:01,439
Well?

93
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,775
You moved.

94
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,811
And?

95
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,682
Now I'm gonna punish you.

96
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:36,007
Ahem.

97
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,542
Ah, you know, usual, coffee,
black, turkey sandwich

98
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:41,145
on whole wheat, lettuce,
mayo, muenster cheese.

99
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,613
Already working on it.

100
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,382
You always take good care of me, Ahmed.

101
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,883
How's the wife doing?

102
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:48,019
She's good, she's good, thank you.

103
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,186
Oh, I haven't seen her in a while.

104
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,389
Where is she these days?

105
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,824
- Our daughter is sick.
- Oh, that right?

106
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,260
That's too bad.

107
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:56,961
- Now, which one is she again?
- Sally.

108
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:59,797
Sally, uh, the young one, right?

109
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:03,200
- Yeah.
- Sally, such a pretty name.

110
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,570
Now, is that traditionally
an Iranian name, or...

111
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,473
Come on, lady, I'm in a rush here.

112
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,343
Jesus H, all right.

113
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,145
God, Calm down.

114
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,580
Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed,

115
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,348
before I get lynched over here.

116
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:23,187
_, am I right?

117
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,292
Um...

118
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,197
and this?

119
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:36,233
DiPierro, he's waiting for us.

120
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,702
Yup.

121
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:20,578
When you look closely at
the seams between order

122
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,646
and chaos,

123
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:25,616
do you see the same things I see?

124
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,651
The strain, the tears,

125
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:31,389
the glimpses of truth hidden underneath.

126
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:33,224
Why do they fight so desperately

127
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,925
to mask what they are?

128
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,128
Or is it that they become who they are

129
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:39,263
when they put on the mask?

130
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,732
Sometimes I wonder what you hide behind,

131
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,267
my silent friend.

132
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,936
What mask do you wear?

133
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:48,906
Or are you just as afraid
as the rest of them?

134
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,908
Me?

135
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:52,510
Am I afraid?

136
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,011
Nah, man.

137
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:57,515
I'm different.

138
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,919
Hey, dipshit,

139
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,922
can't you see we need the ball?

140
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,496
- This ball?
- Yeah, that ball.

141
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:13,597
What, you slow or something?

142
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,266
What's up?

143
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:18,369
Nah, I ain't slow, bro.

144
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:19,470
Go get your own ball.

145
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:20,938
- Yo, man.
- What?

146
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:22,473
What's your problem, son?

147
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,041
- What's your problem?
- You my problem.

148
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:25,376
You need to learn how
to speak to people.

149
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:26,710
Oh, you need to have respect, son.

150
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:28,712
I got it.

151
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,321
Hey, I got it.

152
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,738
We're all just here to
have a good time, right?

153
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,740
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:14,992
Maxine's been acting
a little off lately.

155
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:17,228
She really perked up when she saw you.

156
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:20,164
You a dog person?

157
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:23,767
Used to have one.

158
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:24,902
Oh, yeah?

159
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:28,005
What happened to it?

160
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,609
Don't have her anymore.

161
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,644
Hmm.

162
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,852
Elliot, right?

163
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,288
I'm Ray.

164
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,455
I've seen you here before.

165
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,726
You must like the games, huh?

166
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:49,860
They put Bradstreet in.

167
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,562
He's good on the boards.

168
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:53,597
Come on, boys.

169
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:01,405
Look at these guys. What do you see?

170
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,773
A lot of care and effort

171
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,142
over what amounts to a
pretty shitty game.

172
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:07,211
What's Maxine see?

173
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:10,214
A bunch of dumb animals,
can't think past anything

174
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,083
but getting a ball in a hoop.

175
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:16,387
What do they want you to see?

176
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,789
Badass homies...

177
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:22,393
ready to kill if you step to 'em.

178
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,628
Question is...

179
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,764
which is the truth?

180
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,132
Maybe all of 'em.

181
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,167
Maybe none of 'em.

182
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:33,604
Maybe truth don't even exist.

183
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,273
Maybe what we think is all we got,

184
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,842
which is why I'm a little
jealous of Maxine over here,

185
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:42,313
'cause all she gives a shit
about is eating and sleeping.

186
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,481
Ain't that right, girl?

187
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,424
Not the loquacious type, I get it.

188
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,193
Me, I talk all the time,

189
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:58,362
but I guess you picked up on that.

190
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:00,864
It's cool though. Communication...

191
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,367
is good for my line of work.

192
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:06,170
Takes a lot of it to
run a good business.

193
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,972
But unlike you, when
it comes to computers,

194
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,940
well,

195
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:12,810
I get them about as much as
Maxine here gets E. E. Cummings,

196
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,278
so when I heard...

197
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,346
Whatever you heard, it's not true.

198
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:18,682
I don't do that anymore.

199
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,651
Just tell him you'll help.

200
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,187
Try it once, huh?

201
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:25,055
Let that old feeling come back.

202
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,890
You know, this morning
over breakfast my wife

203
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,827
told me I'd make a friend today.

204
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,028
Not many people to talk to around here

205
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:33,497
except for these knuckleheads.

206
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:36,867
It's cool if we continue talking?

207
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:38,902
No, thanks.

208
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,840
Damn, man.

209
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:47,144
That's some cold, brutal
shit right there.

210
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,146
I'ma have to go listen
to some Adele on repeat

211
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:51,281
when I get back home.

212
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:59,990
Okay, I can take a hint.

213
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,026
Come on, babe.

214
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:08,799
How long you gonna keep us
in this analog nightmare?

215
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,203
As long as it takes.

216
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,571
Without my weapon of choice,

217
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:18,075
Mr. Robot is unplugged, powerless.

218
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,677
He'll try to wear us down,

219
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:21,779
but as long as we stick to the regimen,

220
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:23,714
he can't take control

221
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:28,552
no matter how much of an
illusion he thinks this is.

222
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:30,788
I mean, it's a disgrace,

223
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:35,592
an absolutely disgrace police
have not found this guy.

224
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:37,194
Not only does all the evidence

225
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:40,564
behind the Five/Nine
attacks lead to him,

226
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,599
but he is the leading suspect

227
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,868
behind the Sharon Knowles murder.

228
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,771
I've said it before. I'll say it again.

229
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:52,042
The misogynistic blind eye by
law enforcement in this...

230
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,410
My problem, Stassi.

231
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,245
I hit her for a (BLEEP) reason.

232
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:56,814
She (BLEEP) my ex-boyfriend...

233
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,582
Hey, "Vanderpump's" on.
You want to watch?

234
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,150
- Another time.
- You know what?

235
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:03,887
I'll walk away and let
this be about you.

236
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:06,156
How was I that time? Did I do okay?

237
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,925
I didn't hurt you too bad, right?

238
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,560
You're spoiling it again.

239
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:13,931
At least I didn't break a couple up.

240
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,500
Do you want to go have
a drink at the bar?

241
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:17,768
You know, I know the guy who works here

242
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,770
makes awesome mescal cocktails.

243
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,305
We used to bartend together
back at this place...

244
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,141
We're not to be seen together, remember?

245
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:25,609
That was our agreement.

246
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,117
That's him, isn't it?

247
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:37,654
Freaks me out. Can't he wait downstairs?

248
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,690
He's doing his job.

249
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,631
She's still in the tub.

250
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:52,469
You said 2:00. It's 2:15.

251
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,041
Hand me a towel?

252
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,382
Go.

253
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,884
We can't leave together.

254
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,667
So unfair.

255
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,469
She came out of nowhere a month ago.

256
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:28,138
Sometimes I see her talking to herself.

257
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,207
Oh, my gosh, you did too?

258
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:32,409
So weird.

259
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,977
Yeah, Melissa hates her too.

260
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:36,013
Shit, I got to take this.

261
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:39,216
I'll call you back.

262
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,084
I'm telling you, it's non-negotiable.

263
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,419
No one's going to let you

264
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:43,587
take that question off the table.

265
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:45,022
The money burning is a big part

266
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:46,156
of why everyone wants the exclusive.

267
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,925
Bloomberg, line two for you.

268
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,927
Except for CNN, which
you guys don't want...

269
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:51,929
I got to call you back. Hi, Foster.

270
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:52,996
I thought the deadline was noon.

271
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,498
It's noon now.

272
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,933
It's five past, Angela, and...

273
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,434
Ryder's agreeing to the questions.

274
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,703
He's also giving us top
of the hour and Kelly.

275
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,205
Price doesn't even like Kelly.

276
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,940
I'll budge on the time slot,

277
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,541
but I can't on the question.
It's fair game.

278
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,043
Talk to the segment
producer and call me back.

279
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:07,878
Angela, I already know the answer.

280
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:09,213
You were supposed to make this
happen five minutes ago...

281
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:11,281
Just call me back.

282
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,449
Call Markinson.

283
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:13,750
We don't want CNBC,

284
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,886
or Fox News, for that matter.

285
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,221
I think you should let
Melissa handle this.

286
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,858
- Done deal?
- Not gonna happen.

287
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:23,060
Scott Knowles burning $5.9 million

288
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:24,695
is on the table or not at all.

289
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,029
We're going with CNBC.

290
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,531
They're sending a deal memo as we speak.

291
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,399
You know I would rather go with you.

292
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,068
You got to twist their arm.

293
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,103
Bullshit.

294
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,211
Did you just hang up on Bloomberg?

295
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:44,381
Are you trying to get fired?

296
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,582
Leave.

297
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:49,253
Excuse me?

298
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:51,455
Leave.

299
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,657
When Melissa finds out...

300
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,292
Get her.

301
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:56,827
Go ahead and get her. Tell
her whatever you want,

302
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:59,696
but right now get out
of my fucking cubicle.

303
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,108
Fine, we'll take it off,

304
00:21:45,144 --> 00:21:46,343
but we're talking about the bailout

305
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:47,644
and Plouffe's suicide.

306
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,779
I can't do Plouffe.

307
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:50,781
Then we're walking for real.

308
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,616
Segment producer is pissed
that this is what...

309
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:54,184
The guy committed
suicide on national TV.

310
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:55,519
It's out of respect for his family.

311
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:57,120
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

312
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:58,488
You don't want to ask about that.

313
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:02,059
Please, it's been a month.

314
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:06,897
One question, and I have to approve it.

315
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:08,332
Hi, Melissa.

316
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:10,200
Bloomberg TV agreed to all the points

317
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:11,635
on the exclusive.

318
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,705
Foster's sending you the deal memo.

319
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,041
I need to get coffee
before the staff meeting.

320
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,012
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,412
Coming up to the city
was just a nightmare.

322
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,893
The tunnel was at a snail's pace.

323
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:17,082
E-ZPass is down again.

324
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,423
They're saying indefinitely this time,

325
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,758
but I cannot take the
train in this heat.

326
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,051
It must have been in the 90s today.

327
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,826
Okay, sorry.

328
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,962
So?

329
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,165
I've decided to stay.

330
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,666
We agreed to discuss this.

331
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:35,503
We have for several weeks now.

332
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,205
Need I remind you I was against

333
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,673
you taking Colby's job
offer in the first place?

334
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,542
And then even when you convinced me

335
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,477
that we should wait to
see where it would lead,

336
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:45,313
we agreed it was only gonna
be for a brief trial basis.

337
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:47,582
I think we were both clearly
wrong about their motives.

338
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,417
Oh, I think you are being naive.

339
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,853
And I don't think that we need
to have these talks anymore.

340
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:55,023
I like my job, and I'm not quitting.

341
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:57,792
That's my decision.

342
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:23,251
You never had any intention
of leaving, did you?

343
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:26,688
I know you think they're
pulling something,

344
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,923
but that's because you
can't imagine anyone ever

345
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,260
valuing me as a real asset,

346
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:36,464
when the truth is I've done
more for you and the lawsuit

347
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,403
than you've ever done
for me or yourself.

348
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,872
I have value,

349
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:47,742
and even though you
don't see it, they do.

350
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:52,881
They are barbarians in $10,000 suits,

351
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:56,217
but I see your resolve.

352
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:58,253
I know when to cut my losses.

353
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,930
A guy walks up to a woman at a bar.

354
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,265
He flirts with her.

355
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,933
He makes small talk,

356
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:14,335
but the woman insists she
isn't gonna go home with him.

357
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:17,605
Guy says, "What if I
offer you $1 million

358
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,340
to sleep with me?"

359
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,276
The woman's never had a
million dollars in her life.

360
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:25,513
She stops and considers
the offer very seriously.

361
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,816
The guy changes his mind, says,

362
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:29,251
"What if I change my offer

363
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,019
to a dollar instead?"

364
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:32,854
Woman is aghast.

365
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:34,956
"What kind of woman do you think I am?"

366
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,992
Guy says, "We already figured that out.

367
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,994
Now we're just negotiating."

368
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,485
Are you alone?

369
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,429
Welcome to positive
affirmations volume three,

370
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:24,232
success and money.

371
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:29,871
You'll hear the affirmations
repeated twice.

372
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,273
I will leave a space for
you to either repeat

373
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,642
mentally or out loud.

374
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,811
Please use this on a consistent basis

375
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,247
to form new neural pathways.

376
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:42,717
Good luck.

377
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:45,920
I am confident.

378
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:48,890
I am confident.

379
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:53,595
I am confident.

380
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,097
My confidence is powerful.

381
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:58,933
My confidence is powerful.

382
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:02,604
My confidence is powerful.

383
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,807
I recognize myself as exceptional.

384
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:08,676
I recognize myself as exceptional.

385
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:12,780
I recognize myself as exceptional.

386
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:16,351
I will follow my dreams no matter what.

387
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,686
I will follow my dreams no matter what.

388
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:30,164
Come on, sit down.

389
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,807
Maxine wanted to come over and say hi.

390
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:42,543
She missed you.

391
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:43,878
I think the damn dog

392
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:47,148
might actually like you more than me.

393
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:48,850
See that smile?

394
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,559
Even though we're
technically not friends,

395
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,228
I told my wife we were,

396
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:04,265
was too embarrassed to say otherwise.

397
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:11,472
You know, you two would get along.

398
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,741
She likes to ignore me too.

399
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,643
Hey, man, I don't mean to be an asshole,

400
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,681
but like I said before, I'm all good.

401
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,356
Sorry, I actually don't
know why I'm laughing.

402
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,692
I though you made some joke I don't get,

403
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:32,193
so I usually just fake laugh at those,

404
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:34,095
but...

405
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,432
really, I'm confused.

406
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:41,002
I thought we were on the same page.

407
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:44,405
About what?

408
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:47,942
When we spoke last night.

409
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:51,212
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

410
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:53,648
I didn't see you last night.

411
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:09,630
You really don't remember.

412
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,542
You feeling okay, chief?

413
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,398
That's what the control,
the regimen, the journal,

414
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,767
my perfectly constructed loop,

415
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,435
what this whole thing's been about.

416
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,619
Last night till this morning,

417
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:07,255
while I was sleeping, I
can't account for it,

418
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,357
a gap in my consciousness,
and somehow he...

419
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:14,529
What do they see when
they see you coming?

420
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:17,031
And this is why I'm different.

421
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,467
Sometimes my mask takes over.

422
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:23,771
Why did you talk to him?

423
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:26,374
Because I'm gonna make you realize.

424
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,409
What?

425
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:34,515
What will you make me realize?

426
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:45,226
That they see me.

427
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:05,439
What's so funny?

428
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,108
We started a movement.

429
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,442
We were meant to lead it.

430
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,211
Now, get back on a terminal now.

431
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:13,381
Give me what I want or keep shooting me.

432
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:21,656
Tell me where Tyrell is,

433
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:25,426
or shoot me again

434
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:29,597
'cause the only one it's
gonna drive mad is you...

435
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,566
not me.

436
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:09,804
I'm late for my church group.

437
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,839
Peace.

438
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,047
This time targeting
the Bank of E network

439
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,183
in an elaborate ransomware attack.

440
00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:25,119
The malicious malware targeted
the bank's computer servers

441
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:26,721
and spread to multiple branches

442
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:28,656
in North America, encrypting the data

443
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:31,125
and rendering the systems unusable

444
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,893
until a ransom was paid.

445
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:35,229
This more militant variant
of the hacker collective

446
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,965
forced Scott Knowles, the CTO of E Corp,

447
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:42,003
to burn $5.9 million in public view.

448
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:44,472
Shortly thereafter pictures
surfaced on social media

449
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:47,508
under the name #OPdailyallowance.

450
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,510
Now, this is considered
a direct response

451
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,812
to E Corp's unpopular program,

452
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,548
which would lower their daily
cash withdrawal allowances

453
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,151
for customers to $50.

454
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:59,487
Some stunt, huh?

455
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:02,990
Everybody's laughing it
off as a dumb prank,

456
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:05,660
but these guys know what they're doing.

457
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:09,764
Who thought that hard cash would
be this valuable right now?

458
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:12,500
We're reliving Black Tuesday,

459
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,835
the Great Depression.

460
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:16,537
Warning lights were flashing.

461
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:19,507
I mean, in the last two years

462
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:21,175
the Army Corps of Engineers,

463
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,344
the Energy Department,
the State Department,

464
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:26,280
and the Office of Personnel Management

465
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:28,015
were all hacked.

466
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,551
The government claimed they
were boosting security,

467
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:33,521
but what came of it?

468
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,556
The same as 1929.

469
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,727
Shit hit the fan.

470
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:47,601
An act like this changes
people, changes society.

471
00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:50,738
I'm just having a drink.

472
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,773
I'm sorry,

473
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,410
and I'm rambling like a fanatic.

474
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:01,282
Is there something else
you want to talk about?

475
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,553
The beaches of Barbados,

476
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:09,757
espresso on Rue Montmartre,

477
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,059
sitting around a campfire
in the Adirondacks?

478
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:15,229
I'm married.

479
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:17,264
I'm Brock...

480
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,936
and I know you're Gideon Goddard.

481
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:28,309
- I watch way too much news.
- God.

482
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:31,479
I can't believe I'm a tabloid sensation.

483
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:34,849
More of a diehard fan.

484
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:36,484
I got a smile.

485
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:38,519
I'm on a roll.

486
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:44,492
When did he leave you?

487
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,460
What, was that on the news too?

488
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,497
No, just your face.

489
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:55,970
It's obvious why they
use you as their patsy.

490
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:59,106
You give off a very sympathetic

491
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:02,543
and honest vibe.

492
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:05,679
You're the perfect
vessel for their lies.

493
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,681
Yeah, well, I don't... I don't know

494
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:11,385
what to say to that, but, uh...

495
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:14,054
I'll agree with you that
it sure as hell feels like

496
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,757
there's something bigger
than me in control.

497
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,563
Thank you.

498
00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:24,398
For what?

499
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:27,334
Tomorrow I'm gonna be a hero.

500
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,140
I'm sorry?

501
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:37,144
You may just be a patsy, but
you're an important one.

502
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,380
In fact, I don't think I've ever met

503
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:42,416
a bigger crisis actor than you before.

504
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:47,521
This is for our country.

505
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:47,982
And there shall be no more death,

506
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:50,885
neither sorrow nor crying,

507
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,154
neither shall there be any more pain,

508
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,592
for the former things are passed away,

509
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:00,828
and he that sat upon the throne said,

510
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:03,564
"Behold, I make all things new,"

511
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,165
and he said unto me,

512
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:11,171
"Write, for these words
are true and faithful,"

513
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,140
and he said unto me, "It is done.

514
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,976
"I am Alpha and Omega,

515
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:19,146
"the beginning and the end.

516
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,416
"I will give unto him that
is athirst of the fountain

517
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:26,620
"of the water of life freely.

518
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:30,548
"He that overcometh shall
inherit all things,

519
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,999
"and I will be his God

520
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:35,843
"and he shall be my son."

521
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:02,493
Hello?

522
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:06,234
Is it really you?

523
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:10,648
Who is this?

524
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,397
Bonsoir, Elliot.

525
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,828
