1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,135
I don't have many options.
Someone's closing in on us.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,930
I have to find out what they know.

3
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:07,790
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm hacking the FBI.

4
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,392
With the FBI at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,728
It's Angela. She's our only option.

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,564
- Did you talk to the FBI?
- This is simple.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,766
I'll give you a small device
which you'll take to work.

8
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,769
Drop at the Fed's office on the
23rd floor, and walk away.

9
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,704
We have no other options;
the president can't

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,873
go to Congress with a bailout right now.

11
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,541
Let me know when you've
locked up the votes.

12
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:27,642
What are you up to?

13
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,678
You're not doing anything

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,978
on your end to help.

15
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,213
Yo, yo, yo, yo, please buy my CD.

16
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,314
He got into my system

17
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:33,648
and he wants me to put the CD

18
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:34,916
on one of the computers at work.

19
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,318
Well, I guess I should pay up, Ahmed,

20
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:37,986
before I get lynched over here.

21
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,788
Let me guess. You're excited.

22
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:40,889
Yeah, I'm excited.

23
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,924
We get to go to China.

24
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:45,961
Elliot, before you get started,

25
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,562
I'm asking you to help me

26
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:49,398
and not look where you don't need to.

27
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,166
Are we really back to this again?

28
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,602
Ray is not some coffee shop owner.

29
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,138
Forget what you saw and move on.

30
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,773
Hey! Hey!

31
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:01,076
We're deep down inside you, Elliot.

32
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,144
You can't leave us,

33
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,645
and we can't leave you.

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,686
You're watching USA,

35
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:14,022
America's favorite cable network.

00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,167
Where are we going?

43
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,470
God, Elliot, what's your damage?

44
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,038
Cool it, Darlene.

45
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,973
You know your brother
needs our help sometimes.

46
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,142
That boy of ours.

47
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,643
You sure we're not first cousins?

48
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,650
Where we're going,
Elliot, is a surprise.

49
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,152
Can't say much else.

50
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,187
What I can tell you is,

51
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,323
it's a place that makes
everything better,

52
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,058
a place that changes you.

53
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,326
I should be so lucky.

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,363
I have a hunch that you
just might thank me

55
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,899
once we get there.

56
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:31,934
Why?

57
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,768
What do you mean, why?

58
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,771
This is the annual Alderson
family road trip, that's why.

59
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:38,940
With all of us together,
taking on the world,

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,408
what could possibly go wrong?

61
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,680
What's that sound?

62
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,784
Say, Elliot, what's going
on with you and that girl?

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,887
I always liked her. Angela Moss.

64
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,922
Oh, brother, kill me now.

65
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,859
Me and Angela, we're friends.

66
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:00,262
Ah, I see how it is.

67
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,597
You two are just gonna
keep stringing us along.

68
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:06,134
Elliot and Angela, a regular
will-they-won't-they couple.

69
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,806
Uh-oh, sounds like that
cancer's acting up again.

70
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,208
Looks like it too.

71
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,647
What is that?

72
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,615
That laughing?

73
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,617
Mom, Elliot's hearing voices.

74
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,919
What else is new?

75
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,089
If you're not careful,
Dad's gonna push you

76
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,491
out a window again.

77
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,259
Pipe down, Darlene.

78
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,328
While I'm alive, you need
to treat me with respect.

79
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,462
I'm your father.

80
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:35,664
Not for long.

81
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,612
Eyes up, son.

82
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,515
See, on this journey of life,

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,117
it's best to stay focused
on the road ahead,

84
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,154
'cause if you spend too
much time looking down,

85
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,489
you might just end up with
a crick in your neck.

What?

92
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:43,758
I can feel your bug eyes on me.

93
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,032
Can I see your Game Boy?

94
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,400
No way, you're not allowed.

95
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,369
Your father told you to look ahead.

96
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,004
And you, turn that game down.

97
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,808
Are your fingers broken, young lady?

98
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:03,044
Not yet, but in this family,
it's only a matter of time.

99
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,115
Ow!

100
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,582
You're burning me.

101
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,417
So what if he hears?

102
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,120
How about being more useful

103
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,722
than your sack-of-potatoes sister?

104
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,324
Mama needs a new pack of Slims.

105
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,827
Lights, remember? I'm
watching my figure.

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,611
Somebody help me!

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,346
Help!

108
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,582
Somebody!

109
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,951
I'm trapped in here!

110
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,786
I'm here!

111
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,526
- No so fast, kiddo.
- Isn't that...

112
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,261
Nothing but baggage, sorry to say.

113
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,863
No, no, that was Ty...

114
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,197
We're gonna have to get
your peepers checked

115
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,699
as soon as we get home.

116
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,534
In the meantime, go do
what you got to do.

117
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,035
We shove off in five.

118
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,521
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,822
Hey, no problem, E-meister.

120
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,190
Give me four!

121
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,227
Or not.

122
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,231
Can I help you?

123
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,741
I didn't know you worked here.

124
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:42,544
Well, I started as a
part-time sales associate.

125
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,580
Then they promoted me
to assistant manager.

126
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,483
Now I'm on pace to be full manager.

127
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,151
It almost makes up for
them killing my mom.

128
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,860
Come on, son. Grab what you can.

129
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,562
Cheez-Its, Pringles, Jolt!

130
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,263
What are you doing?

131
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,532
Elliot, stop him, or I'm
gonna call the police.

132
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,409
Can't worry about her anymore, son.

133
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,777
She's one of them.

134
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,712
No, she's not. She's my friend.

135
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,747
I promise, there are
other fish in the sea.

136
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,649
And if you're anything
like your old man...

137
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:27,922
On second thought, don't be
anything like your old man.

138
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,895
All right, gang, let's pack
it up and hit the trail.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,196
Together!

140
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:40,068
Because it's one for Alderson and...

141
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,703
Alderson for one?

142
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:00,154
You guys'll never believe this.

143
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,890
I just had the most messed-up dream

144
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,825
that Mom slugged me in the face.

145
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:10,899
I got to get out of here.

146
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,137
Uh-huh, Buster.

147
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:18,273
Eyes on the road in front of you.

148
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:26,915
Ouch.

149
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,287
Well, things suddenly
aren't looking so hot

150
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,755
for the Alderson clan.

151
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,757
You screwed up another vacation.

152
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,427
All it not yet lost, gang.
I have a donut.

153
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,097
Just have to get it from
underneath my, uh...

154
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,168
Baggage.

155
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,439
Do you really expect me to believe

156
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,941
there's no one in there?

157
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:56,210
Elliot, come on. Not
this business again.

158
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,713
You're really starting
to worry me, kiddo.

159
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:02,216
Did you hit your head
during our little blowout?

160
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,885
Enough of this shit!

161
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,455
Tell me what's happening.

162
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,723
What is this?

163
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,828
Whoa, that doesn't sound good.

164
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,497
On the plus side, I hear
jumpsuits are in these days.

165
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:27,750
Stay tuned for more Mr. Robot
after this commercial messages.

166
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,891
The Internet is where it's at.

167
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,805
And with E Corp Online the World
Wide Web is better then ever.

169
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:42,398
E-mailing and instant messaging.
All from your own computer.

170
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,984
You can even share photos

171
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,265
Our new 208k connection lets you
get online in just minutes.

172
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,375
Every day, more and more Americans are
joining the E Corp Online community.

173
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,992
E Corp Online, the future
is just a click away.

174
00:10:58,332 --> 00:10:59,782
If you just asked for a light beer,

175
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:00,672
Give me a light!

176
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,230
You never know what you'll get.

177
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:07,475
Dogs! Hah.

178
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:10,378
Oh actually, Bud Light!

179
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:17,752
So if you want the clean, fresh
taste that won't fill you up,

180
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:20,788
and never lets you down,
ask for Bud Light.

181
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,210
- Yours?
- No.

182
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,326
- Give me a light!
- Because everything else...

183
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:26,728
Showtime!

184
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:27,763
...is just a light.

185
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,502
Tonight's USA's Up All Night.

186
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:37,807
Grab your popcorn, it's The Careful
Massacre of the Bourgeoisie.

187
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:42,776
It all begins tonight,
at 11, on USA Network.

188
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,549
In times of chaos and uncertainty,

189
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,751
when the world feels off balance,

190
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:48,842
we look to those who've stood with us

191
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:50,577
from the beginning.

192
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:54,352
Since 1884, we've had America's back.

193
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:55,900
We may get knocked down,

194
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,825
but we'll never get knocked out.

195
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,516
We still have your back.

196
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,385
Stay calm, collected.

197
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,355
Follow my lead. It'll always work out.

198
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,826
Car trouble, huh?

199
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,394
He's onto us. Run for it!

200
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:18,066
Gideon, you're alive.

201
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,268
You folks haven't seen a clan of outlaws

202
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:23,071
with a kidnapped corporate
exec, have you?

203
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,773
Yikes!

204
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:34,716
I kill me!

205
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,776
Seem upset, son.

206
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,544
Seriously, Elliot, it's been forever

207
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,748
since that poor cop passed.

208
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,650
It's been 12 seconds.

209
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:11,386
It's time to move past it.

210
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:13,154
Future is bright,

211
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:15,623
endless like that horizon out there.

212
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,995
Whatever you're doing
with me, I don't care.

213
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:23,064
Just take me back.

214
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,632
It's not that simple, kiddo.

215
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,571
Someone help me!

216
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,907
I'm a businessman!

217
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,809
A very important businessman.

218
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,730
You gonna tell me why you took him?

219
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,267
First you're hearing voices.

220
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,902
Now you're seeing things.

221
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,874
He's right in front of us!

222
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,443
We're staring at him!

223
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:11,045
Am I the only one here
who isn't batshit?

224
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:25,126
It'll feel good if you let it.

225
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,995
Believing it's real makes it so.

226
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:33,901
Come on, grab him by the loafers.

227
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,069
Oh, please, gentlemen.

228
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,704
Ankles instead?

229
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,206
The shoes, they're Ferragamo.

230
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:51,919
Hyah!

231
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,967
The laughing.

232
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:12,173
It's a lie.

233
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:16,677
Sometimes lies can be useful, Elliot.

234
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,346
Sometimes they protect you.

235
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,381
And sometimes they help
you get away with murder.

236
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,622
When the truth is painful, son...

237
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,290
and it often is...

238
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,092
a lie is the only remedy.

239
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,795
'Cause too much truth, too much honesty,

240
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,096
that'll kill ya.

241
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,635
This whole place is a lie.

242
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,939
Nothing here is true.

243
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,211
Listen,

244
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,080
I know your gut's
saying not to trust me.

245
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,118
But look around.

246
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:03,458
Everything you see,

247
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,293
it's all here for you.

248
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:10,331
To help you.

249
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:13,935
You should try just going along with it.

250
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,243
This is it,

251
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,511
isn't it?

252
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:28,749
You've won.

253
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,985
You've taken over.

254
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,354
What's that, kiddo?

255
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,527
That's what this is.

256
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:46,367
This road trip.

257
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,569
This family vacation.

258
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,444
I'm buried here.

259
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:05,152
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

260
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:08,189
This was never gonna be permanent.

261
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,292
We did always have a destination.

262
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,868
After the beating you took,

263
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:23,170
at least they got you to a doctor.

264
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,945
You got yourself pretty messed up.

265
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,250
If I were alive, I'd want
no part of that agony.

266
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,089
Nobody's won anything, Elliot,

267
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,025
especially not me.

268
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:49,263
I'm just trying to help you
put it all in the rearview

269
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,999
as painlessly as possible.

270
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,872
Bring 'er in, kiddo.

271
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:09,083
Now that the worst is behind you,

272
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:10,785
it's time we get you back.

273
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,408
Maxine, my dog.

274
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:41,215
Started to develop a
cough two weeks ago.

275
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,618
She got pretty frail pretty quick.

276
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,887
Fell over a few times.

277
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,256
According to the vet,

278
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,825
she danced with the wrong mosquito,

279
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,927
got herself a...

280
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:56,430
nasty case of heartworm.

281
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,734
She was moved to a little
room off the basement,

282
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:02,970
had a water heater for a roommate.

283
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:04,939
Before she got sick,

284
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,309
Maxine lived like her own operator.

285
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,811
Didn't seem to cross her mind
that she belonged to someone.

286
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,750
But in that basement,
she needed human hands

287
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,985
to give her every scrap of food,

288
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,553
every pill...

289
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,290
Occasional light.

290
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:40,274
For the first time, she realized

291
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,009
that she continues to breathe

292
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:45,379
because someone else allowed it,

293
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,015
that she had a master.

294
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:53,454
Now, I'm no vet,

295
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,489
but I think that realization
might have killed her

296
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,992
before the parasites had a chance.

297
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:06,033
Anyway, I'ma quit yapping,

298
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,703
let you rest.

299
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,538
Big days ahead.

300
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,206
Work to do.

301
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,850
We can sit here and complain,

302
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,686
or we can go out there
and enjoy ourselves.

303
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,188
I'm gonna sit here and complain.

304
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,225
Well, not everyone enjoys
spending their vacation

305
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,893
in a rain forest.

306
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,029
We're in this rain
forest because of you!

307
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,230
I vote we go home.

308
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,498
You're not voting on this.

309
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:38,699
Call the newspapers.

310
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,067
Democracy is dead.

311
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:51,257
It's been two days since
the shocking terror attack

312
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,959
at Beijing's Bayi Lake Hotel,

313
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:55,664
and while the exact death
toll has yet to be released,

314
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:56,888
an anonymous source...

315
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,724
Owning the FBI was never gonna be easy.

316
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,994
But now... everyone's on high alert.

317
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,529
We'll be fine.

318
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,866
We only have one day.

319
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,634
You heard what Angela said.

320
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,337
An inter-office email stating
that the FBI's CART team

321
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,239
is vacating E Corp tomorrow.

322
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,540
We don't have a shot

323
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,908
once they're back at the field office.

324
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,476
She'll be ready.

325
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,878
Darlene.

326
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,679
We just started teaching her.

327
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:25,383
For someone like Angela,
learning all of this in 24 hours

328
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,819
is next to impossible.

329
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,622
Uh... that?

330
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,660
Okay, uh, you know what?

331
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,562
It's... pause.

332
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,433
Maybe you need to... sometimes
it helps to visualize it, okay?

333
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,834
So here.

334
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,603
Your network cable is gonna be plugged

335
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,172
into one of these suckers.

336
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,874
That's a battery-powered
home-brewed mobile tower

337
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,443
called a femtocell.

338
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,446
Now, this guy won't help
us get on the FBI network.

339
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,514
That won't be accessible at E Corp.

340
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,383
What this guy will do is force

341
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:01,019
every FBI cell phone to connect to it

342
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:05,123
so it can get every email,
text message, and document.

343
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:09,227
Now, you SSH in, run the first script.

344
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:13,231
Period, forward slash,

345
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,201
EnableAttack, space,

346
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:19,204
femtopwn, space,

347
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,738
WLAN0, comma,

348
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:24,375
WLAN1, space, two.

349
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:28,880
No... Uh, that's...

350
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,748
Yeah.

351
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,417
I will get this.

352
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,219
Let's just try it again.

353
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:36,287
Mm-hmm.

354
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:39,124
Um...

355
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,159
okay.

356
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,293
This is a Rubber Ducky.

357
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:46,231
All else fails, you find an FBI
laptop anywhere on the floor.

358
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,433
They're usually Panasonic Toughbooks.

359
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,767
Plug this guy in,

360
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,970
wait 15 seconds, then yank it, okay?

361
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,172
Thanks to a tool called mimikatz,

362
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,075
it'll pull all cached
passwords and domain info in

363
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,110
and save them on this.

364
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,444
Won't give us everything

365
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,746
but might help lead us somewhere.

366
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,249
Just a backup plan.

367
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,985
Okay. Let's try again.

368
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,622
You can't teach someone
to hack in one day, okay?

369
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,190
I don't know how we'll
be ready by tomorrow.

370
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,125
- We need more time.
- Well, we don't have it.

371
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,628
And once they leave E Corp, we're done.

372
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,597
Okay, just keep working on
the scripts with Angela.

373
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,432
Rise and repeat, again and again.

374
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,434
Wax on, wax off.

375
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,371
Do whatever you got to do,
but this is happening.

376
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,506
Okay, the holdup on the femtocell

377
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,041
isn't helping either, okay?

378
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,343
I still need to load the
exploit, need to test it...

379
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,945
It'll be here.

380
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,314
Cisco's still modding
and swapping antennas.

381
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:49,894
_

382
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:52,239
_

383
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,394
_

384
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,678
_

385
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,889
_

386
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:08,827
_

387
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,663
_

388
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,811
_

389
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:21,983
_

390
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,319
_

391
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,014
_

392
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:32,756
_

393
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,788
_

394
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,248
Really, man?

395
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:45,083
I thought we were on the same team.

396
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:47,185
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no.

397
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,786
What the fuck, Xun?

398
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,788
What the fuck is going on?

399
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,459
Get off me, man! Xun,
what the hell's going on?

400
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,929
Xun, Xun, just wait. The
fuck's going on, man?

401
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,964
What the fuck is going on, man?

402
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,800
Get off me. Get off me.

403
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,068
Fuck, dude.

404
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,670
Get off me, man.

405
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:08,522
_

406
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:09,608
_

407
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,376
No, no, stop, stop, stop. No, no, no.

408
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:12,411
No, no, no, no, no.

409
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:13,478
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

410
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,647
_

411
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,061
_

412
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:21,830
_

413
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,038
_

414
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,168
Agent Ramos recommends
four weeks' psych leave.

415
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,605
And you know I don't take
his evaluations lightly.

416
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:46,077
You were also there.

417
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,112
I was in my room.

418
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:50,248
I got lucky.

419
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:51,449
You were smack in the middle.

420
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,750
You owe yourself some time.

421
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,086
I can't go away for a month.

422
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,788
I won't.

423
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:59,123
We disrupt the investigation,
the Dark Army wins.

424
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,092
Chinese are pointing to a
group of Uighur separatists.

425
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,660
I told you what I saw at the airport.

426
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:04,595
What you saw doesn't mean anything.

427
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,631
Excuse me, but I disagree.

428
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,533
We were there to investigate the hack,

429
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,168
and then we were under fire.

430
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,703
That is not a coincidence.

431
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,273
By all reports, the Dark
Army are just hackers.

432
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,974
It's not their MO to shoot up a hotel

433
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,676
teeming with FBI.

434
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:21,779
Violent separatists would
have taken more victims.

435
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,648
I clipped one of the
shooters in the leg.

436
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,350
He went down, hit the floor.

437
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,484
He could have kept firing.

438
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,885
I read the reports, DiPierro.

439
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,021
He turned the gun on himself.

440
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,824
He erased his history.

441
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,693
And the other shooter
actually had me cornered.

442
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,562
I was done.

443
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,797
Swear to God.

444
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,332
But instead, for some reason,

445
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:42,867
he also put his weapon to his head

446
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,503
and pulled the trigger.

447
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,372
Their mission wasn't to slaughter us.

448
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,341
If it was, I wouldn't be here
arguing with you right now.

449
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:52,310
They were there to disrupt
our investigation,

450
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,511
to send us home,

451
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,613
and to leave nothing behind.

452
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:59,016
I don't know what to say.

453
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,085
Everyone's emotional because
of this Beijing thing.

454
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,754
Revenge is on everyone's minds.

455
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,555
The drums of war. I know you hear them.

456
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:06,524
Be that as it may, Mr. Speaker,

457
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,093
there are ways to drown them out.

458
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,996
With enough passion, people
will buy into anything,

459
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,931
especially at times like these.

460
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,900
The Chinese tied our hands on this one.

461
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,102
If I try to advocate
borrowing from them now,

462
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,405
the American public
will call me a traitor.

463
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,106
And, Phillip, frankly,

464
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,175
I don't even know if I
disagree with them.

465
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,077
Don't shit a shitter, John.

466
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,846
You enter this pissing
contest with China

467
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:32,850
instead of passing this bailout,
the country goes bankrupt.

468
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:34,252
Believe me, I would if I could.

469
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:36,020
A bailout.

470
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,556
No one can make that happen,
not in this climate.

471
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:39,991
I'm sorry, Phillip.

472
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:45,763
Minister Zhang's office
has been unreachable.

473
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,634
That cocksucker.

474
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,437
Well, call him again...

475
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:54,772
and again and again and again.

476
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,442
Don't fucking leave until you get him.

477
00:27:59,913 --> 00:28:01,245
Where's my car?

478
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:02,647
I'm late for my next appointment.

479
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,081
Sorry, sir.

480
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,283
The driver's having trouble

481
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,151
getting into the parking structure.

482
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,454
Protesters have surrounded the building.

483
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:20,865
Tell Bratton to summon as
much NYPD as is necessary.

484
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,111
My success is assured.

485
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:38,182
My success is assured.

486
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,486
My success is assured.

487
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,056
My success is assured.

488
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,359
My success is assured.

489
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,129
My success is assured.

490
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:56,934
Um, you know you can't talk to yourself

491
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,203
during the actual operation?

492
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,805
Whatever it takes,

493
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,807
as long as you're almost
ready for liftoff.

494
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,142
We settled on midtown JW?

495
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,144
23rd floor, Eastside View.

496
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,646
This'll be during their lunch hour,

497
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,314
so the floor should be pretty empty.

498
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,550
Okay,

499
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,684
we're officially good to go.

500
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,832
The hell is this?

501
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,753
Nothing.

502
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,588
I thought I recognized your friend,

503
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,757
but I don't.

504
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,931
I'll wait for your
call when I get there.

505
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:07,151
Jesus.

506
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,933
At least you still got
a few of these left.

507
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,002
I cannot get through a day
in that E Corp building

508
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:14,438
without juicing, you know what I mean?

509
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:21,645
Hey, how soon till you re-up on, um...

510
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:25,950
Everything?

511
00:30:25,985 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh, well, that's it for this place.

512
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:33,157
I thought I could weather
the storm, but that's...

513
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,325
I can't.

514
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:41,932
I know it's rough out there,
but you're a survivor, Ahmed.

515
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:46,303
Yeah, well, not when I
can't pay the rent.

516
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,340
With this cash allowance,
no one's coming in.

517
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,642
No customers, no inventory.

518
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,477
No more of the best damn turkey sandwich

519
00:30:53,513 --> 00:30:56,180
in the tri-state.

520
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,348
Heh.

521
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,821
Man, I'm real sorry.

522
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:05,856
Yeah. Thanks.

523
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:12,296
Well, I guess I got to take advantage

524
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,232
while I still can, right?

525
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:17,234
How about it?

526
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,637
Turkey sandwich on whole wheat.

527
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,806
Oh, yeah, okay.

528
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:23,674
Lettuce, mayo, Muenster.

529
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:04,415
Yeah, hi, I'm in room 2301.

530
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,217
I just used my last towel.

531
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:08,352
I'm running out for a sec but
was wondering if someone

532
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,855
could leave a few extras by my door?

533
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,956
Thank you.

534
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,096
Oh, hi.

535
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:20,764
Oh, there's no conditioner in my room,

536
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,133
and I'm sure gonna need
it with this humidity.

537
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,402
You know how it is.

538
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,373
Thanks, doll.

539
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:37,041
Are we still on for lunch?

540
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:38,375
Yeah, I'll be there.

541
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:29,694
How's it going?

542
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:06,363
Shit.

543
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:19,877
Shit.

544
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,045
What's up?

545
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,579
The script, it isn't working.

546
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:24,048
Mobley, are you on?

547
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,316
Yeah, what's on your terminal?

548
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,752
"EnableAttack not found."

549
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:34,191
Everything okay?

550
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:38,762
Angela, what's happening?

551
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,469
Angela?

552
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:51,341
I'm good.

553
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:53,110
Okay, you have to change your path.

554
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:56,480
CD, bin, hit Enter.

555
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:58,749
- Done.
- Now run the script.

556
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,588
And we are live.

557
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:05,989
Wi-Fi interface is up.

558
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,459
Communicating with femtocell.

559
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:09,927
Good work.

560
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,261
We're almost there. Do your thing.

561
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:15,699
Is everything okay?

562
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:17,634
Who the hell is that?

563
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,869
Yeah.

564
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:20,170
Fine.

565
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,940
You were in there awhile.

566
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,875
I didn't mean for that to sound weird.

567
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,343
I just noticed because
I've never seen you

568
00:36:26,378 --> 00:36:28,979
on this floor before.

569
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:31,682
I wanted to make sure
you're all right is all.

570
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,383
We don't have time for this.
Get rid of him.

571
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:37,054
Anyway, I'm Agent Ross Thomas, CY-5.

572
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,956
Mobley, you're getting the transfers.

573
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,525
Anything?

574
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,659
Angela.

575
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:44,027
He hails from San Diego,

576
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:45,896
relationship is complicated.

577
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,632
So what's it like?

578
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,334
Knowing that every room you walk into,

579
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:52,703
at least one person is quietly
trying to muster the courage

580
00:36:52,738 --> 00:36:54,371
to ask you out.

581
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:57,174
Jesus, end this before I hurl.

582
00:36:57,209 --> 00:36:58,909
Mobley.

583
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:01,078
He's been in the bureau
for under a year.

584
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:02,980
Was infosec before then.

585
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,481
I don't really think about that.

586
00:37:04,517 --> 00:37:06,250
Don't have much yet.

587
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:10,354
Well, would you think
about drinks with me?

588
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,023
Say, tomorrow night?

589
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,591
I'm actually seeing someone.

590
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:16,593
Oh, come on. I'm not proposing.

591
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:18,996
It's one drink.

592
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,831
I won't take no for an answer.

593
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,333
I'm flattered, but I really
have to get back to work.

594
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:24,668
I've got something.

595
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,703
He calls his mom a weird amount,

596
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:29,907
and I will exploit that weirdness.

597
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:33,677
This floor, it's
off-limits to non-bureau.

598
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,445
Did you know that?

599
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:36,947
I thought you all were moving.

600
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:47,257
Well? You want to tell
me why you're here?

601
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:49,860
Shit, Mobley, I'm looking too.

602
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,062
Angela, hold on a sec.

603
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,463
I'm waiting.

604
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:58,402
So that's all you got?

605
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,137
A little brush-off and you give up?

606
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,709
I just wanted a little flight.

607
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:07,778
No one's ever handed a win.

608
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:15,419
What are you doing for lunch?

609
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:17,955
Busy tomorrow, but...

610
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,124
I can meet you downstairs.

611
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,492
Like, 30?

612
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,300
I know a great Greek
place around the corner.

613
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,538
I'll see you in a half.

614
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,612
All right, you need to find a cubicle

615
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:43,280
with a network switch under it.

616
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,815
Should be on the ground.

617
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,618
Lots of Ethernet cables
and flashing LEDs.

618
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,138
Found one.

619
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:09,539
All right, put the battery backup down

620
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,141
and the femtocell next to it.

621
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:13,377
Plug the battery backup
into a power strip.

622
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,947
Do not unplug the femtocell
from the battery backup.

623
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,615
After that, plug the other end

624
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:21,151
of the yellow network
cable into the switch.

625
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,996
Don't forget to wipe your
prints from everything.

626
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,599
Okay, the femtocell's plugged in.

627
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:17,207
You killed it.

628
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:18,742
Go celebrate.

629
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,217
Shit.

630
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,522
We lost Wi-Fi.

631
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,424
You need to get to a terminal
and bring it back up.

632
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:38,895
Screw you. I did what you asked.

633
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:40,731
If we can't get the interface to load,

634
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:42,432
then we can't use the
Juniper ScreenOS backdoor

635
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:44,201
to own the network,

636
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,602
which means I can't wipe
the security footage

637
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:46,937
of you planting the femtocell.

638
00:40:46,972 --> 00:40:48,238
You're fucking kidding me.

639
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:49,373
Just get to your cubicle.

640
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,108
I'll walk you through it.

641
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:16,046
Masters. We all have them.

642
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:19,450
Every relationship's a power struggle.

643
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:22,686
Some of us need to be controlled.

644
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,689
Once in a while, the
best course of action

645
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:28,292
is to just ride shotgun.

646
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,394
Stare at the road ahead,

647
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,630
and hope it leads
somewhere you want to go.

648
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:45,042
There's a USB flash drive in that bag.

649
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:47,478
When you get to your cubicle,
power off your machine,

650
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:50,548
plug the flash drive in,
and power it back on.

651
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,050
Hold F12 to bring up your boot options.

652
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:55,519
Make sure you boot from USB.

653
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:01,692
Make sure live AMD64 is highlighted,

654
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,395
then hit Enter.

655
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,697
When the desktop comes
up, open a terminal.

656
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,265
Click on the icon of the black screen,

657
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:12,036
just like you practiced.

658
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,671
Okay, now I need you
to type the following:

659
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:15,706
SSH, space,

660
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,741
dash L, space,

661
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:19,410
root, space,

662
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:25,445
L4713116.e-corp-usa.com.

663
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,798
I lost my place.

664
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,900
The last thing that I entered was three.

665
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,937
116.e-corp-usa.com.

666
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:49,975
Okay.

667
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:51,775
Okay, password: joshua.

668
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,379
Homestretch... you're
gonna have to bring up

669
00:42:55,414 --> 00:42:56,947
both Wi-Fi interfaces.

670
00:42:56,983 --> 00:42:58,983
Ifconfig, space,

671
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:01,552
WLAN0, space, up.

672
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:02,587
Done.

673
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,622
Last one.

674
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,489
Ifconfig, space,

675
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:08,792
WLAN1, space, up.

676
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:12,329
Angela Moss, is that right?

677
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:19,436
Oh, you in the middle of a call?

678
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:20,671
I'm sorry.

679
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:22,106
I hate when people do that to me.

680
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,607
Go ahead. I can wait for you to finish.

681
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:39,383
Before you get all bent out of shape,

682
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:42,653
all I was trying to do was
take those punches for you.

683
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:43,854
That's it.

684
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,972
Thank you.

685
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,477
So if I had to guess,

686
00:45:40,513 --> 00:45:44,248
I'd say you didn't tell
Principal Howard your side?

687
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:50,821
You know, it's okay to talk about stuff,

688
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:53,390
to share your side of things.

689
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:57,828
I'm here to listen.

690
00:45:57,863 --> 00:45:59,496
Always will be.

691
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,234
You don't feel like talking right now,

692
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,769
nobody's gonna force you.

693
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,079
Hopefully you're okay
with listening, though,

694
00:46:15,114 --> 00:46:17,314
'cause...

695
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:20,818
I actually have something to share,

696
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:23,087
something I'm pretty embarrassed about.

697
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,325
Mr. Fitch, my supervisor...

698
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,494
you met him, big bald guy,

699
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:32,329
looks like that guy from "The Simpsons"

700
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:35,699
that you don't like very much.

701
00:46:35,735 --> 00:46:37,968
A few Fridays ago, he
calls me into his office,

702
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,503
sits me down,

703
00:46:39,538 --> 00:46:43,707
and immediately starts
reading off a list of dates.

704
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:47,678
September 8th, August 29th, August 2nd.

705
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,682
Few more.

706
00:46:51,717 --> 00:46:56,520
He goes on to tell me that
because of these dates,

707
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:59,223
my contract is being terminated.

708
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:03,293
I was being let go.

709
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,129
I asked him why.

710
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:06,697
He didn't answer.

711
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:09,333
He just thanked me for
my time, wished me luck,

712
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:13,070
excused himself, no further explanation.

713
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,208
What were the dates?

714
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:23,747
They were all appointments
with a doctor.

715
00:47:23,783 --> 00:47:27,451
I had to leave early
for some blood work.

716
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:31,522
What? What do you mean?

717
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:36,860
I'm sick, Elliot.

718
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,062
That's what they're telling me.

719
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:40,764
For a while now.

720
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,703
I've been trying to
keep it from everybody.

721
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,339
Your mom, Darlene,

722
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:52,409
work, you.

723
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:03,587
Come on, kiddo.

724
00:48:03,622 --> 00:48:07,224
World isn't gonna get
rid of me that easily.

725
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,792
I'm gonna be okay.

726
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:15,098
I'm never gonna leave you.

727
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:16,867
Promise.

728
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,272
Oh, come on.

729
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:26,210
Enough of this gloom and doom.

730
00:48:26,245 --> 00:48:30,514
Why dwell on the past when we can
take a peek into the future?

731
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,751
The site of my new gig.

732
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,287
That's where I'm taking you.

733
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:40,324
I'm opening a store...

734
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:42,726
computers.

735
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:44,561
Everybody wants to have one.

736
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:45,796
We love 'em.

737
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,598
Figured it made sense.

738
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,166
You're gonna have a computer store?

739
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:51,435
Mm-hmm.

740
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,938
Can I work there?

741
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:58,141
Yeah, don't see why not.

742
00:48:58,177 --> 00:49:01,111
In fact, I will give you your
first assignment right now.

743
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,147
I want you to come up with a name.

744
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:10,587
What? Stores need a name, right?

745
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:13,323
I can name it whatever I want?

746
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,524
All right, tell you what.

747
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,426
When we pull up,

748
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:19,997
the first thing that
comes into your mind,

749
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:23,200
that'll be the name.

750
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:24,601
Really?

751
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,308
Now, it's coming up here on the right.

752
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,777
Just keep those eyes on the road.

753
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:45,622
Now, I don't have the keys yet,

754
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:48,992
so we can't go in.

755
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,661
I just closed on the place.

756
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,697
It's a bit of a fixer-upper,
but it'll get there.

757
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:57,668
It's awesome.

758
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,436
Thought you'd like it.

759
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:06,677
Hey, uh, back there,

760
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,912
what we talked about,

761
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:11,648
let's just keep that between us, okay?

762
00:50:11,684 --> 00:50:12,684
Don't even tell your mom.

763
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,385
Just our little secret.

764
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,525
Good.

765
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,361
Now, you have work to do.

766
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,164
This place needs a name.

767
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,333
Now, remember,

768
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:31,935
the first thing that
pops into your mind.

769
