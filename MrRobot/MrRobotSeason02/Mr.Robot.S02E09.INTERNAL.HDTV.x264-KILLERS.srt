1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:03,100
Every relationship's a power struggle.

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,853
Some of us need to be controlled.

3
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:06,572
Why did you first start listening to me?

4
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:08,397
I just followed your lead.

5
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:11,005
- I don't want to be a leader.
- I want my position moved

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,541
to the risk management department.

7
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,589
If we pull milestone cases
like Washington Township...

8
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,157
There's not much we can do here today.

9
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:19,126
Closing the plant is not an option.

10
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:21,795
I'm being pressured to resign.
Not doing anything to help.

11
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,263
What did you say your name was?

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,499
- I'm Ollie.
- This is a rubber ducky.

13
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,267
It'll pull all cached passwords.

14
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:30,370
It can get every email,
text message, and document.

15
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,638
You guys just got hacked.

16
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,042
Jesus, what is that noise?

17
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,543
Tape's busted. Grab another one.

18
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,878
All of you can't accept the fact

19
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,780
that maybe we fucked up.

20
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:41,615
Who knows who's gonna be
waiting for you at home?

21
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,717
Dark Army, FBI, cops.

22
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,186
He hacked me and stole
my dog on top of it.

23
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:47,721
That proves it was him.

24
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,356
Where do you think you are right now?

25
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,991
- What do you mean?
- You haven't been staying

26
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:52,192
with your mother.

27
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,665
People always told me growing up

28
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,834
that it's never about the destination.

29
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,105
It's about the journey.

30
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,842
But what if the destination

31
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:10,410
is you?

32
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,045
Elliot Alderson.

33
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:14,081
Are you Elliot Alderson?

34
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,751
Mr. Alderson, you're under arrest

35
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,586
for unauthorized use of a computer,

36
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,989
computer trespass, and grand larceny.

37
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,724
- Grab the computers.
- Let's go.

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,725
Get the hard drives.

39
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,027
All the USB drives.

40
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,196
- Any digital media.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,864
Check everywhere.

42
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:34,735
Get animal control here for the dog.

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,503
Let's go. Let's go.

44
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,708
Put your arms up. Spread 'em.

45
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:53,053
Put your left thumb on there.

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,761
- You suicidal?
- No.

47
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:04,431
- You a drug addict?
- No.

48
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:10,103
- You on any medication?
- No.

49
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,740
- How you feeling right now?
- Great.

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,410
I've spoken with the prosecutor,

51
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,978
and we can get the
hacking charges reduced.

52
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,315
The theft charge is a
little more difficult.

53
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,217
The plaintiff is really
upset about the dog,

54
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:27,254
but I think we can negotiate.

55
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:31,892
Hey, you heard what I said, right?

56
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,661
When the judge asks you for a plea

57
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,964
you say,

58
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,665
"Not guilty."

59
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,534
Got it?

60
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,405
In the case of People vs. Alderson

61
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:48,208
how does the defendant plead?

62
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:56,684
Guilty.

63
00:02:57,853 --> 00:03:00,787
You're shitting me.

64
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:02,623
Mr. Alderson,

65
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,425
you do realize Mr. Lenny Shannon's dog

66
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:08,695
was an expensive purchase at $1,200?

67
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,530
That makes your theft a felony.

68
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,640
Let the record show,

69
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:23,210
Mr. Alderson nodded his head
up and down indicating "yes,"

70
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,146
and you're admitting you hacked into Mr.
Shannon's email,

71
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,215
social media, and bank accounts,

72
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,983
which will convict you on both counts

73
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,219
of computer hacking?

74
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,325
Again, let the record show,

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,562
Mr. Alderson nodded his head
up and down indicating "yes."

76
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,665
You're aware of the gravity
of these allegations?

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,867
You will be sentenced to jail.

78
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:50,671
What the fuck are you doing?

79
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:53,240
Yes...

80
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,741
and I plead guilty.

81
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,743
Do you make this plea out of free will

82
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,478
- and free mind?
- No! No.

83
00:03:58,514 --> 00:04:01,214
He's fucking crazy.

84
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,083
Yes.

85
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,488
Mr. Alderson, I declare you guilty

86
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,724
of computer hacking, computer trespass,

87
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,492
grand larceny of fourth degree.

88
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:15,696
I hereby sentence you to
18 months in county jail.

89
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,898
Adios, you son of a bitch.

90
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,710
- This your first time here?
- Yes.

91
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:31,912
Do you have any intention
of harming yourself?

92
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:33,747
- No.
- Sit.

93
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,751
Don't move.

94
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:40,587
Put your chin on the bull's-eye.

95
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:43,390
Do not move.

96
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:46,293
Right side.

97
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,101
All right, let's go.

98
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:04,311
Need you to swing by at 3:00 p.m.

99
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,815
Problems with RT again.

100
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,650
Yes sir, Warden.

101
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:18,125
Let's go.

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,626
Get naked.

103
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:33,907
Let's go. Get undressed.

104
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,509
Hurry up. All right, let's go.

105
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,310
Get undressed for me.

106
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,248
Squat down. Turn around.

107
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:42,683
Let me see the bottoms of your feet.

108
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:44,417
Your left foot. Now bend over.

109
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:45,786
Spread your ass. Bend over.

110
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,487
Spread 'em.

111
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,194
Read this right here,

112
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,762
confirm that these are
all of your items,

113
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,931
and sign right here.

114
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,933
Speedy Gonzalez.

115
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,668
Fucking amazing, man.

116
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:03,436
Arrested, arraigned,

117
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:06,940
convicted within 24 hours.

118
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,776
Yeah, we heard about you, cuz.

119
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,344
In fact,

120
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,814
you're the only guilty
man in the entire pen.

121
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,183
You know that?

122
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:18,285
Leon.

123
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,986
Okay, that's cool.

124
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,855
It's best you learn soon,

125
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,891
'cause you don't wanna be
alone in a place like this.

126
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,127
Check it out. I'll give you the lowdown.

127
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,663
Routine. That's key.

128
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,131
It's best you find your routine,

129
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,333
whatever it is, and stick to it.

130
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:35,001
Mornings, we chow.

131
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,337
Afternoons, we hit the ball court.

132
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:40,540
Evenings, that's when I get my TV time.

133
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:43,410
Some people join church
groups, or AA, or whatever,

134
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,580
but I like to bench personally.

135
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,748
Peace, brother.

136
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,152
Ain't no Internet for us here.

137
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:54,387
Your best bet is going
through some boxes

138
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,323
in the library full of old,

139
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,391
throwback classic DVDs.

140
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,393
You know what I'm saying?

141
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:03,196
I'm making my way through
the '90s right now.

142
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:06,399
Nearly finished with "Mad About You."

143
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,668
You know, my man Paul Reiser...

144
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:11,238
he just doesn't get the
credit he deserve.

145
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,440
Man is spectacular.

146
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,443
Phenomenal.

147
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,511
Think I'ma start watching
"Seinfeld" next.

148
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,547
I heard it's nails.

149
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,585
You look nervous, cuz.

150
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,754
Don't be.

151
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,856
Just do you.

152
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,058
I mean, I'd say we got a pretty solid

153
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,894
rapport going on anyway.

154
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,897
We stick together,
things'll be just fine.

155
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,936
Oh, that's Hot Carla.

156
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,105
If you're a pyro,

157
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,440
she's your chick with a dick.

158
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:49,776
Know what I'm saying?

159
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,012
Probably not.

160
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,887
Oh, whatever you do

161
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:05,325
stay away from these David Duke
motherfuckers right here, man.

162
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,632
You don't say much, do you?

163
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:17,304
- No.
- Well, that's cool, man.

164
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,740
I'm here to provide you
with anything you may need.

165
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:24,144
I can pretty much find
anything, and I mean anything.

166
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:27,814
Smokes, pills, hard shit,

167
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,985
porn, grandma porn.

168
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
Some of these guys like that shit.

169
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,822
Gay porn.

170
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:36,990
I don't judge, man.

171
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,192
Whatever you need.

172
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:49,035
Can you get me a notebook?

173
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,727
See you in the morning.

174
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,712
That's how it happened.

175
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:34,681
That's all you missed.

176
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,182
That's everything.

177
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,509
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

178
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,461
You got everything you arrived with?

179
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,134
Sign here stating such.

180
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,577
Here's a discharge report
and the early release form.

181
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:07,047
Give that to the officers at the door.

182
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:13,553
You have the hack to
thank for that letter.

183
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:16,423
I never released this many
non-violent offenders before.

184
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,358
This mess with the economy

185
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:20,727
is affecting the prison budgets too.

186
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,596
You got lucky. Don't squander it.

187
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,603
That card's worthless out there now.

188
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,138
You want it for sentimental value,

189
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,941
or should I toss it?

190
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,376
Toss it.

191
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:42,949
Init 5, return to normal.

192
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,289
Is it possible to return

193
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:52,792
after 86 days in a 6x9-foot box?

194
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,525
Init 5 is supposed to
bring color and sound.

195
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,931
Instead the world's gray and quiet.

196
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,609
Joseph Green's office. Monica speaking.

197
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,812
Hi, Monica. I'm a junior partner

198
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,546
at Johnson, Lerner, and Carlin.

199
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,015
I have sensitive documents for Mr.
Green regarding

200
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,384
- this Flint water case.
- Send them over.

201
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,019
I'll make sure he gets them right away.

202
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:52,955
I'm actually downstairs right now.

203
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,024
Super. Leave 'em at reception.

204
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,559
I'm sorry. I was told these are

205
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:58,394
very sensitive documents

206
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,663
and to only deliver them
straight to Mr. Green

207
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,331
or your hands.

208
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,500
Sorry. I can't leave my desk,

209
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,802
but Mr. Green is out of
the office until 2:00,

210
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:09,004
so he's not gonna read
them right away anyway.

211
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,740
Obviously I would just
bring them up myself,

212
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,408
but security down here is insane.

213
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,243
Can you please just come down?

214
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,682
Okay, I'll be right down.

215
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,663
Oh, hey.

216
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,972
Monica.

217
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,974
Uh, tell Joe to give me a call

218
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,244
when he gets back from lunch, will you?

219
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Sure.

220
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,032
Hurry up.

221
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,103
I hacked my Dark Army contact.

222
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,072
Found an archive with screenshots

223
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,607
of his IRC chats with them.

224
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,375
Something called Stage 2.

225
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,244
It has to do with the femtocell.

226
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,079
I tried to tell Trenton and Mobley,

227
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:38,681
but I couldn't get in touch
with either of them.

228
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,083
I called, message checked
all the usual haunts.

229
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:43,118
Both are AWOL.

230
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:46,221
Okay, Trenton's parents are a wreck.

231
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,123
They filed a missing person's report.

232
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:51,860
Between them missing and
the channel archive

233
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:54,063
I'm freaking out.

234
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,198
I think Dark Army could
be cleaning house.

235
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,967
That doesn't make sense.

236
00:16:58,002 --> 00:17:01,203
I think they're behind my early release.

237
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:04,039
We need to talk to your contact.

238
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,109
We're not

239
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:09,912
really on the best of terms right now.

240
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,480
Doesn't matter.

241
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,282
They can't do this.

242
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,751
This wasn't part of the deal.

243
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,357
Let's keep moving.

244
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,629
Out through the basement,
I'll leave through

245
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:28,931
the side door, and we'll
meet at the seven.

246
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,433
Not yet.

247
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:33,602
I'm going to see her.

248
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,437
What do you mean?

249
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:38,007
I thought this was
just to lose our tail.

250
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,677
Elliot, you're actually
gonna go see her?

251
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,946
We seriously need to talk.

252
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,080
Shit has gone down.

253
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:47,116
I need to do this.

254
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:53,155
Okay.

255
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,090
Just be quick.

256
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,725
I'll wait in the stairwell.

257
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,176
Mom?

258
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,522
They taking care of you?

259
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,526
Room looks nice.

260
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,731
I'll see if they can fix the clock.

261
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,866
Looks like it's broken.

262
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,906
How are you?

263
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,182
A lot's happened

264
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,984
since last I saw you.

265
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,420
Had a really hard time.

266
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:02,257
Anyway,

267
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,927
just wanted to say thank you.

268
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,433
You helped me survive
these last couple months.

269
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,972
I don't think I could
have done it without you.

270
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,821
Okay.

271
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:42,131
Take care.

272
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,278

288
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:16,582
Init 5 is supposed to be simple.

289
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,318
A fresh start.

290
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:21,087
Restored connections.

291
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:24,858
This may be my first
real moment of normalcy.

292
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,493
Taking a piss in private.

293
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:30,063
You hit me in the face
with a fucking bat!

294
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:31,431
Thank God I didn't need stitches!

295
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,166
Well, I should have hit you harder.

296
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,602
We've been over this for
the last three weeks.

297
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:38,204
Okay, I've walked you through
every IRC conversation.

298
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,407
I am not gonna let this go.

299
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:42,075
Why the fuck are you
sending pictures of me

300
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,376
while I'm asleep to the Dark Army?

301
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:45,545
How many times do I have to tell you?

302
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,047
Letting them know that you're
with me keeps you safe.

303
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,581
I was trying to protect you.

304
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,550
Then why aren't you
telling me about Stage 2

305
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:52,252
and what you guys did
with the femtocell?

306
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,753
We've been over this a million...

307
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,723
You've both got to calm down!

308
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:04,097
Yes, the shit has
officially hit the fan.

309
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:07,600
Here's what we're gonna do.

310
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:10,403
Okay, okay. Let's all take a beat.

311
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,142
We're gonna settle down here.

312
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:19,479
Relax.

313
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:21,314
Elliot?

314
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:28,354
Hey, Elliot. You all right?

315
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,295
Elliot?

316
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,331
Come back to Earth.

317
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,367
I thought you wanted to
find Mobley and Trenton?

318
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,776
Yeah.

319
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:53,513
Yeah.

320
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:56,916
We need to know what
happened to them, right?

321
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:59,285
I can't keep up with you two.

322
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,854
Look, I'm not risking my
life to help with this.

323
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,322
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

324
00:23:02,357 --> 00:23:03,757
Your Dark Army contact.

325
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:04,991
You have one?

326
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:05,992
You must.

327
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:14,000
If they find out I was
involved, it'll be my ass.

328
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,136
Okay? I'll be the next one missing.

329
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,770
Only there won't be any questions

330
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:20,206
about where I went.

331
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,213
You better be more
reliable than your sister.

332
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,660
Hey,

333
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:43,196
what the hell just happened?

334
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:46,065
I was gonna ask you the same.

335
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:51,237
Why were you talking with them?

336
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,839
What are you talking about?

337
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:55,408
One second everything was normal.

338
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,011
All of a sudden, you stopped responding.

339
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,345
It was like you shut down.

340
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:02,015
I had to say something.

341
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:07,353
It's unfortunate what both your country

342
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:09,189
and the company have been through

343
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:12,892
in the last several weeks.

344
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,727
Yes.

345
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:18,231
A succession of unfortunate events.

346
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,833
The timing of which
almost seems intentional.

347
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:23,770
Well, at least there's
good news for both of us.

348
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:26,839
Your little pet project

349
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,742
came through even better
than you thought.

350
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:32,512
I must admit, she surprised me.

351
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:35,982
It's a good thing that she did
the right thing in the end.

352
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,284
It's too bad.

353
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,919
You know, for all she's done,

354
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:41,621
it won't matter.

355
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:43,556
The failure of the
bailout has left me in

356
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:45,258
a rather obsequious position.

357
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,760
We failed our financial stress test,

358
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,362
so we won't be able

359
00:24:49,397 --> 00:24:52,065
to keep up all our facilities.

360
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:59,239
As of noon this Friday,

361
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:02,108
I'm sorry to say, the
Washington Township plant

362
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,110
will be taken over

363
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:07,146
by the federal government.

364
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:09,582
And here I thought we were

365
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,751
taking a step forward,

366
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:15,455
but here we stand two steps back.

367
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,958
Your actions remind me of
your predecessor, Phillip.

368
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:22,395
And here comes the veiled death threat.

369
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,433
You wanna take a shot at me?

370
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:29,969
Be my guest.

371
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:32,171
The appointment of a new CEO

372
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,340
isn't going to stop the
federal government

373
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:36,442
from taking over the plant.

374
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:42,415
I flew for 13 hours and 35 minutes,

375
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,085
if you have a point, it's time.

376
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:48,821
I needed that bailout money,

377
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,257
and I no longer have it.

378
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:53,326
Thanks to your little shootout in China.

379
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,628
What do I need now?

380
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,964
Cash.

381
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,300
Lots of it.

382
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:03,536
I could see a scenario where
the Chinese government,

383
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,338
in a bid to establish itself

384
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:09,008
as the new global leader
of the 21st century,

385
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:12,045
loans E Corp the money it needs...

386
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:17,183
At a low interest rate.

387
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:20,153
Perhaps even zero.

388
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:23,556
As a gesture of goodwill
to the American people.

389
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:26,292
With that cash, I could save your plant

390
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:28,628
from the clutches of the
federal government,

391
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,129
and finally,

392
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:33,800
when a peaceful China
appears benevolent,

393
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:36,536
well...

394
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:38,237
That's an easier pitch

395
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:41,908
for me to get onto the President's desk.

396
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,511
I will be happy to go back and talk

397
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,879
with the Chinese government.

398
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:49,716
I'm sure that they will
be most agreeable,

399
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:51,751
but the next time you
threaten my plant...

400
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:53,753
What?

401
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:57,557
What?

402
00:26:57,592 --> 00:27:01,494
The only move left in that
scenario is a third World War.

403
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:04,564
You see? I'm a mercenary.

404
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,399
I don't play fair.

405
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:09,369
I play what I want.

406
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:10,804
When you deal with a mercenary,

407
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:13,039
then all decorum gets
tossed out the window,

408
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,441
so you go ahead with your cute threats

409
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:17,677
and your watch beeps.

410
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,545
Order

411
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:22,081
will not protect you anymore, my friend.

412
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:26,352
I will rain chaos,

413
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:30,356
even if it hurts me,

414
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,059
'cause I would rather see you lose

415
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:36,295
than win myself.

416
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,468
Oh.

417
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:45,037
That's all the time I have.

418
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,608
On May 9th, we took down

419
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,544
the world's biggest conglomerate.

420
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:53,479
We all had the same intention...

421
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:57,450
me, Darlene, Mobley, Trenton, Romero...

422
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:59,385
to change the world,

423
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:01,254
but there was one other player,

424
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,055
the Dark Army.

425
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:05,892
We never did find out what
their intentions were.

426
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,897
Pwnie Express pwn phone.

427
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:15,134
A phone loaded with 103 network
monitoring and attack tools.

428
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,838
A dream device for
pentesters and hackers.

429
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,573
His name is Xun.

430
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,809
Xun's boss is Whiterose,

431
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,144
who helped us bring down Evil Corp.

432
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,247
Xun and his people wanted the femtocell.

433
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,415
Why?

434
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:30,783
I don't know,

435
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:33,352
but soon we'll know everything.

436
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:35,955
We're hacking Xun.

437
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,525
Something's not right.

438
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:41,828
I feel off.

439
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,497
It's like we're overheating.

440
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:50,269
We'll be fine.

441
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,905
We're up. I've got a connection.

442
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:58,277
Time to set the meet with Xun.

443
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:00,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
No, no, no.

444
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:01,881
I thought we were operating from here?

445
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,317
This only gets his phone mic live.

446
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:06,486
I'm going to ask them about Stage 2.

447
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:07,820
What?

448
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,489
Even if they don't tell me anything,

449
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:11,724
at least it'll get
them talking about it,

450
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,493
and that's all we need right now.

451
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:14,794
Oh, my God. Jesus, bro,

452
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:16,295
you're just like your sister.

453
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:17,997
First the number. Now the meet.

454
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:20,199
I mean, you don't stop.
I'm not doing it, man.

455
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:23,402
These guys won't think twice
about killing you on the spot.

456
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:28,207
Trust me.

457
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:30,843
I have a way to get him talking.

458
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:33,145
Fuck yeah. I would love to meet him.

459
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:36,782
No, he's not meeting you.
He's meeting Mr. Robot.

460
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,588
What'd you say?

461
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:45,691
Nothing.

462
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:48,728
I meant me.

463
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:50,696
Me. He's meeting me.

464
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,868
Something's happening with us.

465
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:57,870
We can't do this.

466
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:01,741
I got this.

467
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,961
This is big.

468
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:23,095
How did you get...

469
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:25,531
The levels of toxicity are still

470
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,067
above regulation,

471
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:29,936
right?

472
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:38,544
What's the next course of
action in a case like this?

473
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,581
Uh, well, this definitely
falls under what we call

474
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,449
substantial and specific danger

475
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:46,152
to public health and safety.

476
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:47,587
You know we're bound by law

477
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:50,289
to protect your anonymity, right?

478
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:52,158
There could be money
for a whistle-blower

479
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:55,294
in a situation like this.

480
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,495
You're gonna wanna get a lawyer.

481
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,898
I'm not doing this for the money.

482
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,800
I just want it to happen fast.

483
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:04,837
Okay.

484
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:07,239
I'll take this to the deputy director.

485
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:09,408
You mind sticking around for a while?

486
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:10,844
No.

487
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,139
Hey!

488
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:42,684
Hey!

489
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,119
Hey...

490
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:47,422
All right, yo. This is our stop.

491
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,326
Yo, I don't get it.

492
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:52,861
Are you nervous or something, man?

493
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:55,029
- Because you can't be...
- No, I...

494
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:58,566
Never mind. I'm good.

495
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:06,065

496
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:12,136

00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,431
Flying drone into the capital
of this great nation.

503
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,167
Meanwhile, the FBI

504
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:35,536
gets caught with its
hand in the cookie jar

505
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:38,506
trying to work in legal gray areas.

506
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,342
Listening in on phone calls.
Reading emails.

507
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:44,345
The FBI has 3 million of
you innocent citizens

508
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,781
under surveillance for no reason.

509
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,183
Okay? The backlash?

510
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:50,952
It boggles the mind.

511
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,288
If you've got nothing to hide

512
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,923
then what do you have to worry about?

513
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:57,458
Especially, at a little surveillance?

514
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,927
- Oh, shit.
- Help bring down

515
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,129
the world's worst criminals.

516
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,932
The FBI needs to catch this guy

517
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,934
by what... means necessary.

518
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,071
...symbol of capitalism.

519
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:14,042
Unless it falls on the
capital's doorstep

520
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:15,777
that's not vandalism.

521
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,446
That's a victory lap, people!

522
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,449
Tyrell Wellick wants us to know,

523
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:24,252
he's not done...

524
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,880
_

525
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,776
_

526
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,925
_

527
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,002
- Why are they leaving?
- They weren't expecting you.

528
00:35:16,172 --> 00:35:18,172
Look at me!

529
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:29,684
Tell Whiterose I wanna
know what Stage 2 is.

530
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,493
Second one tonight.

531
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:14,862
Brownouts. We've been bracing ourselves

532
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:17,532
since Comet Electric went on strike.

533
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,401
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Deputy Director Phelps.

534
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:21,936
Office of Investigations.

535
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,372
- Hi.
- Jeff told me a little about

536
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:26,407
what you've brought us.

537
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:29,777
Can you come with me?

538
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,347
My colleagues and I wanted
to ask you a few questions.

539
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:37,018
We're so indebted to citizens like you.

540
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,453
Thank you.

541
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,055
I never cease to be
astonished by the heroics

542
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:43,791
of everyday people.

543
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,428
Did you come all the way down
from New York just for this?

544
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:50,465
Or are you based in New Jersey?

545
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,933
You know, I should probably get

546
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:55,403
some contact information from you.

547
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:58,473
- Jeff promised anonymity.
- Which is a nice idea,

548
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,608
to be sure.

549
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:02,043
Is Jeff going to be in the meeting?

550
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:03,744
I know. It sounds complicated,

551
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,413
but how it works is the
commission will want

552
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:09,584
to discuss this with
you after they review.

553
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,419
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but...

554
00:37:11,454 --> 00:37:14,655
You do work at E Corp, yes?

555
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,426
What?

556
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,096
I never said that.

557
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:24,132
What is your position there?

558
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,567
The more we know about the
origins of these documents

559
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:28,369
the quicker we can process them.

560
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,409
Actually, could I get my
files and the drive back?

561
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,979
You've made it all the way down here.

562
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,814
Let's not stop now, shall we?

563
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:41,516
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,751
This trip has taken a lot
longer than I thought it would,

565
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:47,421
and I can't miss the last train back.

566
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:48,990
But, Angela, my colleagues

567
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:51,459
in the other room are
eager to talk to you.

568
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,700
No, thanks.

569
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,170
I gotta go.

570
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:18,219
- How'd it go?
- Everything's on track.

571
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,188
Good.

572
00:38:20,223 --> 00:38:21,656
The lights have been flickering.

573
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:23,324
Yeah. The streetlights too.

574
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,226
- Brownout's started.
- Hey.

575
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,863
I gotta talk to you for a minute.

576
00:38:28,898 --> 00:38:31,899
I left that busted VHS
tape at the Smart House.

577
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,469
- What VHS tape?
- That fsociety video.

578
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:36,837
Relax. I'm sure we got it.

579
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,839
- We cleaned the place good.
- No, I left it.

580
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,074
It's not here.

581
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,343
We wiped the whole house down.

582
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:44,045
Do you remember grabbing it?

583
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,415
I know I didn't.

584
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,017
- We have to go back.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Darlene.

585
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:52,086
We cannot go back. That
was a goddamn month ago.

586
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,554
The cops could have been there already,

587
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,822
and you're just remembering this now?

588
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:56,424
It doesn't matter. I have to go.

589
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,393
Fucking hell, Darlene. I swear.

590
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:01,996
Why are you even using VHS
tapes in the first place?

591
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:03,497
Because it's cool?

592
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,433
There's a million filters on Final Cut.

593
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,335
My face is on that tape.

594
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,172
Fine. Fine,

595
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,840
but I'm going, all right?

596
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,243
Feds are looking for you, not me.

597
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:17,044
Where is it?

598
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,914
I think I set it on that weird lamp

599
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:21,515
in the living room.

600
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,384
Maybe it fell behind.

601
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:24,418
All right.

602
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:27,555
Uh, hang on.

603
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,124
Thank you.

604
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,559
Really.

605
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:50,278
You look burnt.

606
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:57,018
Yeah, I'm getting tired.

607
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,591
You can stay here and
crash on the couch.

608
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:08,095
Home would be better.

609
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:10,631
I'm not feeling right.

610
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:14,769
They're gonna be watching.

611
00:40:14,804 --> 00:40:17,471
All the more reason.

612
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:21,676
I need them to see me
living a normal life.

613
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,145
Oh, good point,

614
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,682
but assume the worst.

615
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,685
Your place is probably bugged.

616
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,953
Be careful coming back here.

617
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:35,623
I'll stay up and keep listening.

618
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:15,366
Hey, one of your fellow tenants
let me in the building.

619
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:16,901
Look what I got.

620
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:18,736
Your favorite. Nia's gyros.

621
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,706
Mind if I come in?

622
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:23,774
Actually, yeah. I'm...

623
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,445
Don't worry. I left
my handcuffs at home.

624
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,450
Wow.

625
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:34,251
Gosh.

626
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:37,054
Nice place.

627
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,557
They really take good
care of you here, huh?

628
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:44,328
E Corp housing?

629
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:02,113
Are you working for them?

630
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:07,251
Working for who, Angela?

631
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:12,089
I need you to leave.

632
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,401
I had this dream,

633
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:27,772
which if you know me, is pretty rare.

634
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,408
It was good at first.

635
00:42:30,443 --> 00:42:31,976
Exciting.

636
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:35,513
There was the beautiful woman.

637
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:38,182
Sexy even.

638
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,654
But then, man, did it go downhill fast.

639
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,324
By the end, I was being
choked underwater.

640
00:42:57,403 --> 00:43:01,539
Ollie Parker told me
about the CD at Allsafe.

641
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:03,808
It was literally the first
thing out of his mouth

642
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:06,644
when we interviewed him two months ago.

643
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:09,213
I've been having you tracked ever since.

644
00:43:09,248 --> 00:43:10,715
Including your little field trip

645
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,652
out there to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission today.

646
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:17,388
It's clear you're freaking
out about something.

647
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:19,890
I don't know how any
of this ties together,

648
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:21,625
but...

649
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:23,961
eventually someone
will connect the dots,

650
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:25,996
and it'll catch up to you.

651
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:31,802
So I'm being real with you right now.

652
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,039
Next person's not gonna offer you food.

653
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:36,507
They're gonna grab you off the street

654
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:39,376
and throw you in a dark cell.

655
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:49,153
But you still have one hand to play.

656
00:43:49,188 --> 00:43:51,188
That's me.

657
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:12,276
In that dream I had,

658
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:15,946
when I was being drowned,

659
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:18,949
it was when I stopped fighting it.

660
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:20,251
When I finally let go

661
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:22,720
and stopped struggling so much...

662
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,490
That's when I survived.

663
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,298

- Elliot.

669
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,721
_

670
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:08,058
_

671
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:09,526
_

672
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:13,227
_

673
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:25,843
It began as a failure.

674
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:27,478
Everything.

675
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:29,046
My existence.

676
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,881
I should recognize that.

677
00:46:30,917 --> 00:46:32,583
Accept it.

678
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:35,686
For me there's no such
thing as normalcy.

679
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:38,589
My dead father appears
and disappears at will.

680
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:41,558
I talk to you, an invisible friend.

681
00:46:41,594 --> 00:46:43,861
I'd ask if you're normal,

682
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:46,196
but you never talk back.

683
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:48,766
_

684
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:51,326
_

685
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,818
_

686
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,583
_

687
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:59,295
_

688
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,134
_

689
00:48:00,272 --> 00:48:01,805
How can I return to normal

690
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:04,408
when the SUV belonging
to the man I murdered

691
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:06,276
is parked outside my apartment?

692
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:14,818
Normal?

693
00:48:14,854 --> 00:48:17,488
I have no normal.

694
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:33,656
Hello, Ollie.
