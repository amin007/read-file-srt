1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:02,046
What if this all went away?

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:04,018
The money, this city, all of it?

3
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,687
The world is filled with stupid people,

4
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:06,955
and I get paid a lot to be smart.

5
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:11,288
Susan Jacobs,

6
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:12,961
the general counsel at E Corp.

7
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:14,752
Madam executioner.

8
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:17,773
The tracking on her phone is working.

9
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:19,364
How long you think she's
gonna stay away for?

10
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:20,046
Long enough.

11
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,625
Have you ever considered which
part of our scheme motivates you?

12
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:26,389
The FBI announced today
Tyrell Wellick and fsociety

13
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,781
engaged in this attack.

14
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:30,917
Are you alone?

15
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:34,287
That's called a femtocell.

16
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:36,188
So we can get every FBI email,

17
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,890
text message, and document.

18
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:39,358
We just owned the FBI.

19
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:42,194
They have something called
Operation Berenstain.

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,729
Possibly heavy surveillance.

21
00:00:43,765 --> 00:00:46,032
Ah!

22
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,433
They're trying to cover their tracks,

23
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,068
and right now, we're the tracks.

24
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,289
Oh, uh, go ahead.

25
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:14,794
Oh, whole milk.

26
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,830
Must be some kind of revolutionary.

27
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,832
Uh, no... I, um...

28
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:22,401
Just 'cause everyone's into this
almond coconut shit nowadays.

29
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:24,904
It's, um...

30
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,339
not...

31
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:50,096
What kind of phone do you have?

32
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:51,297
Oh, uh, this?

33
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,933
Um... yeah, it's... it's a Nexus.

34
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,534
Yeah, I'm an Android guy.

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,969
Uh, hate Apple.

36
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,639
Think iPhones are for pussies.

37
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:00,773
What are you on?

38
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,575
iPhone.

39
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,511
Right.

40
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:12,518
You think they suck so
much, but they're faster.

41
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,653
Uh...

42
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,221
Bullshit.

43
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:16,722
I mean, if you're talking boot times,

44
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:17,857
then it's Android all day,

45
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:19,392
and if you're talking net speed,

46
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,627
Chrome on Android has
better HTML5 compliance

47
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:26,132
and runs JavaScript so
much faster than Safari.

48
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,533
No competition.

49
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,802
Oh, yeah?

50
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:31,137
Prove it.

51
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:33,339
Go to this benchmarking website.

52
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,643
We'll compare speeds.

53
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,178
Okay.

54
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,047
Game on.

55
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:46,986
Ugh, are you on the Wi-Fi here?

56
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,587
Yes.

57
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,589
It's slow as shit.

58
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,825
Agreed. It's hit or miss.

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,827
There's another Ron's Coffee Shop.

60
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,562
Oh, 14th Street. Yeah, I know.

61
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,364
Everyone always Reddits about that one.

62
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,865
Crazy fast.

63
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:02,568
You can practically stream
4K videos on your laptop.

64
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,073
Why aren't you there now, then?

65
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,945
You got me.

66
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,548
iPhones suck.

67
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,251
I'm, uh, meeting someone.

68
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,087
What about you?

69
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,422
- Same.
- Cool, cool, cool.

70
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:30,863
Oh, the old malicious
browser benchmark trick.

71
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:33,866
I see you already own
this newb's whole system.

72
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,901
I like it.

73
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:38,471
Didn't your mom ever tell
you not to surf websites

74
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:40,940
that have an embedded
Stagefright exploit?

75
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,808
Can't drop the proverbial soap

76
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:45,244
around a black-hat bitch
like this, Mobley.

77
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,882
Darlene, I...

78
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,650
I thought I was meeting Elliot.

79
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,453
Me too.

80
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,924
Relax, kids, this isn't the
stranger danger episode.

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,094
Elliot couldn't make it,
but no need to connip.

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,696
I'll download you.

83
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,600
Well, I'm not gonna shout.

84
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,168
Get over here, tubs.

85
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,269
Don't...

86
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,674
Before we start, he wanted me
to read you guys something.

87
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,444
Now, keep in mind these
are his words, not mine.

88
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,947
He's a touch melodramatic.

89
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,450
"What I'm about to tell
you is top secret.

90
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:26,519
"A conspiracy bigger than all of us.

91
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:28,521
"There's a powerful group
of people out there

92
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:30,422
"that are secretly running the world.

93
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,591
"I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

94
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,160
"the guys that are invisible,

95
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,196
the top 1% of the top 1%"...

98
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,950
Mm.

99
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,331
And this is happening tomorrow?

100
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,399
Mm-hmm.

Please wait while you're
joined to the conference.

105
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,555
Hello?

106
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:38,224
Hello.

107
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,993
Hey, Douglas Gitelman, WFO.

108
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:44,496
Lorin Connor, FBI New York.

109
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:47,166
Hi, guys, Michael Kirkpatrick, New York.

110
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,667
Anyone else on?

111
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,502
Just waiting on you.

112
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,338
Hello, all. Everyone on?

113
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:55,107
It's Kirby, Megan, and Zach
from the seventh floor.

114
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:56,709
Yup, all here.

115
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:58,377
Great. Don't have a ton of time.

116
00:05:58,412 --> 00:05:59,945
It is the nation's birthday, after all,

117
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:01,881
so let's get down to brass tacks.

118
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:08,254
E Corp, Google, AT&T, Uber,

119
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,522
Apple, Verizon, Facebook...

120
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:13,592
all 23 of these listed
companies have been complicit

121
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:16,395
in aiding the FBI in
Operation Berenstain.

122
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:21,000
Jesus, what is that noise?

123
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,072
Okay, tape's busted.

124
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,375
Just grab another one
and we'll do it again.

125
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,609
Yeah.

126
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,455
Okay. Fuck it.

127
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,757
I'll keep it simple.

128
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,727
Happy Fourth of July, fellow Americans.

129
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:52,064
On this patriotic holiday,
we wanted to remind you,

130
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,100
under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

131
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,136
privacy is a right.

132
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,737
Or at least it used to be.

133
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,940
Listen closely to a
classified conference call

134
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,775
we recently intercepted

135
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,976
between the FBI agents

136
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,911
that so earnestly promise you

137
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,348
fidelity, bravery, and integrity.

138
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,805

139
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,087

140
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,875
_

141
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:22,345
_

142
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:26,258
_

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,200
Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million.

144
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:30,970
They got us the 17 we're
building our case around now.

145
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:32,399
_

146
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,983
_

147
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:35,941
Doesn't help that Comey
hasn't signed off on it.

148
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,509
The fact that we're keeping it from him

149
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:38,944
does not bode well for your case.

150
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,946
He's an uptight choirboy.

151
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,148
No one's gonna be crying over
how we catch these terrorists.

152
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:44,817
I guarantee that.

153
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:47,052
The FBI has 3 million of
you innocent citizens

154
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,722
under surveillance for no reason.

155
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:53,993
Their tyrannical rape of
our private data ends now.

156
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,195
FBI, be warned.

157
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,999
Your access to our lives
is officially denied.

158
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,034
Pursue us at your own peril.

159
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,736
We do not compromise.

160
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,671
We will not back down.

161
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,306
We will destroy you.

162
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,574
We are...

163
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,808
fsociety.

164
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,999
Smartphone out there...

165
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:35,501
It's never going to be...

166
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,036
Come on, Kirby, screw the 3 million...

167
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,737
Video's up.

168
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:40,539
- 16 in the code name case.

169
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,608
Right, 16. One's deceased.

170
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,177
It doesn't help that Comey
hasn't signed off on it.

171
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:48,580
Stop listening to that. It's
making you more paranoid.

172
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:51,683
What about this, um,
code name case thing?

173
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,920
They said they have 16
suspects under surveillance.

174
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:57,189
Video's getting hits. It's
starting to get reposted.

175
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:00,592
They said one of the suspects

176
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,294
is dead.

177
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,731
They gotta be talking
about Romero, right?

178
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:09,401
We have to be on that list.

179
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:10,903
I uploaded the full Berenstain call

180
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,538
and transcript to WikiLeaks.

181
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

182
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:15,974
Come on, slow your roll, bro.
No one's going anywhere.

183
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,376
We gotta monitor the
fallout of the video

184
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:18,777
before anyone makes a move.

185
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,112
Exposing their program

186
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,480
is gonna shut down the investigation.

187
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,881
I don't care anymore.

188
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:23,982
I'm officially done.

189
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,651
You don't wanna do this.

190
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:28,420
You mean the, uh... the Dark Army

191
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,757
doesn't want me to do this, bro?

192
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,959
No, no, no, no, I mean you.

193
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,395
'Cause when the Dark Army
finds out the FBI nails you,

194
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,063
- which they will...
- Mm.

195
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,398
It's lights out.

196
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,133
No questions asked. You feel me?

197
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,570
Hey, stop.

198
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:46,472
You really think you
can force me to stay?

199
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:48,674
Without a doubt.

200
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,342
Guys!

201
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,699
Happy Fourth of July,

202
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,367
fellow Americans.

203
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:16,935
On this patriotic holiday,

204
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,770
we wanted to remind you,

205
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:21,607
under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

206
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:24,009
- privacy is a right...
- Yo.

207
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:27,012
We're still on a date, remember?

208
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,215
Why is this video such
a big deal to you?

209
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,553
I'm gonna get another drink.

210
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:48,700
Hey, hey there, Ang.

211
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,338
Steve?

212
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:54,706
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,041
Oh, karaoke.

214
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:59,578
You know, gotta please the missus.

215
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:03,048
Missed you at your dad's barbecue today.

216
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,583
Yeah, I couldn't make it.

217
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,051
Right. Yeah, right.

218
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,753
You gotta be busy these days.

219
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,821
Congrats on everything.

220
00:11:09,857 --> 00:11:13,091
Still, though, that's gotta be
tough on your father, though.

221
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,726
Having to watch while you bow down

222
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:16,728
to those bastards that
killed your mother.

223
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,566
That can't be an easy
pill for him to swallow.

224
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:25,037
For you, though, swallowing's
not really a problem,

225
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:28,207
now, is it?

226
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:32,444
Just, uh, who the hell do
you think you are, anyway?

227
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:57,135
You're a plumber.

228
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,770
Right, Steve?

229
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:03,976
You've had, what,

230
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:07,746
60 years at life?

231
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:10,182
That's the best you can come up with?

232
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,820
Literally cleaning shit for a living?

233
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,925
I'm 27,

234
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,460
and I've got a six-figure salary

235
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:25,264
at the biggest conglomerate in history,

236
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,366
and I'm just getting started.

237
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,433
That's who I am.

238
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,845
Don't do this!

239
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,328
Now you're only at class B

240
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,086
felony kidnapping charges.

241
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:51,320
Don't bump it up to class A.

242
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,389
Shut the fuck up!

243
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,328
You have no idea the shit you're in.

244
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:07,942
One of us should have
been watching the GPS.

245
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,910
This is some next-level shit, man.

246
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:11,278
Okay, we didn't have a choice.

247
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:12,713
We couldn't let her go to the cops.

248
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:14,415
Yeah, well, she can ID all of us now.

249
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,183
She saw everything, our whole setup.

250
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:19,220
- She knows who we are.
- Help!

251
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,522
Hello? I know you can see me!

252
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,759
God damn it. Trenton, go shut her up.

253
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,160
Go!

254
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,090
Fuck it.

255
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,025
I say we take our chances out there.

256
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,694
Let her go. Take off.

257
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,396
- Go our separate ways.
- Yeah, right.

258
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,864
Then there'll be a manhunt
with our faces on it.

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,266
Yeah, if there isn't one already.

260
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,600
Hello!

261
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:48,375
I need the bathroom.

262
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,743
Not yet.

263
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,879
I kinda can't control it.

264
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,681
Let me check downstairs first.

265
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:57,551
I really need to go.

266
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,619
It'll only take a second.

267
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,364
You guys don't know what
the hell you're doing,

268
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,999
do you?

269
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,102
You're Muslim?

270
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,440
Is that what all this is about?

271
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,877
ISIS or something?

272
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,713
You're all a bunch of goddamn animals.

273
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:29,216
Make it quick.

274
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,452
We were all there. You heard the call.

275
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,788
They have a secret
surveillance program on us.

276
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,623
Jesus, you're a broken record.

277
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,892
Man, you wanna live in denial?

278
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:41,661
Go ahead, okay? Go right ahead.

279
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,764
All of you can't accept the
fact that maybe we fucked up.

280
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,099
Okay? Take a look at the city.

281
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:47,434
It's going to shit, man.

282
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,902
Now, first it'll be blackouts.

283
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,237
Then it'll be the National Guard.

284
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:51,605
- Either we go now or...
- Jesus!

285
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,607
Keep it together!

286
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,778
Um...

287
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,814
Darlene.

288
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,353
This isn't exactly what I
meant by "shut her up."

289
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,691
Okay, well...

290
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,693
maybe our problem solved itself.

291
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,296
Oh, so, what, we just let her die?

292
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:18,198
We need to get her to a hospital.

293
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,367
No.

294
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:23,703
No, not until we're sure she won't talk.

295
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,871
Tie her up.

296
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,973
That's a nasty head wound.

297
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,808
Okay, well, then we
don't have much time.

298
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,510
To do what?

299
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,179
Own her.

300
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,666
Grab her phone.

301
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:56,836
Got it.

302
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,904
I'll jump on her laptop.

303
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,385
She's got three email
accounts on her phone.

304
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,526
Not seeing anything on her
corporate or Hotmail.

305
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,272
There's gotta be something
we can blackmail her with.

306
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:33,573
Just keep looking.

307
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,230
I got into her Gmail. Don't
see anything in here.

308
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:58,565
Did you check for any hidden partitions?

309
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,201
- Obviously.
- I'll check the office.

310
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,609
- Okay, anything?
- No, nothing.

311
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:13,380
She's a lawyer. She's gotta have dirt.

312
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,615
Wait, I see Yahoo Mail
in her web history.

313
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,450
Maybe we do a pass on her drive?

314
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,152
Try to recover any deleted files.

315
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,928
Maybe we could target
Yahoo's server logs

316
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,164
and cross-reference any
incoming connections from here.

317
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,133
Might lead to an account
name and password hash.

318
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:36,102
- I could use bash bug.
- Or what about this?

319
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,453
What if we do find
something on her, huh?

320
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,488
What then?

321
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:00,760
Cazadores on the rocks, please.

322
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:06,599
I love that song.

323
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:10,003
You really have a desire
to rule the world?

324
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,042
Oh, my desires go way beyond that.

325
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:22,649
Pretty sure my daughter's
older than you.

326
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,853
What about your granddaughter?

327
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,723
No, no, she'll be ten tomorrow.

328
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,692
I'm taking her to the zoo, actually.

329
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,699
Thanks.

330
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:43,403
Well, better get back to my colleagues.

331
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,205
You could do that,

332
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,374
or you could stay here,

333
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,376
talk to me.

334
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,984
I had nothing to do with Five/Nine.

335
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,993
I'm in finance, for fuck 's sake.

336
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:02,795
You think I wanted to
implode the economy?

337
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,829
Come o...

338
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,090
No, I agree with Mr. Jones here.

339
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,893
I've been scratching
my head on this one,

340
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:12,861
but evidence is evidence,

341
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:16,265
and holiday or not, I had
to follow up on this.

342
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,202
Found this incriminating little guy

343
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:23,038
at a critical location tied
to the Five/Nine hack.

344
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:26,175
The shell's microstamp leads
right to your client's gun.

345
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,077
The gun that he had in the
city of New York illegally,

346
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,211
I might add.

347
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:34,583
Immunity is on the table

348
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,752
in exchange for a name.

349
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:41,323
That's all I care about.

350
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,183
Let's keep this friendly.

351
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,702
I need a doctor.

352
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:31,106
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

353
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,942
Nice place you got.

354
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,645
Comfy.

355
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,914
Is your place in Greenwich this cush?

356
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:17,386
I worked hard for what I have.

357
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,628
You know, I'm glad

358
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,664
you came home,

359
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,232
but my friends

360
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,668
are freaking out.

361
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,369
Came up with this neat little plan

362
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:37,539
to blackmail you for your silence.

363
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,941
Hacked your emails.

364
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:43,979
We got some good stuff too.

365
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:48,050
Nice little Petraeus email
scam you got going on there.

366
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,518
You shouldn't get hot and heavy

367
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:51,386
with your presiding judges, Suze.

368
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,189
I'm sure you're aware that's illegal,

369
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,892
but...

370
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:00,863
I know you don't care
about things like that.

371
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,598
You'd slime your way around it

372
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:05,200
and fuck us over just
like you did my dad.

373
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:11,840
Who's dead, by the way.

374
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,475
But you...

375
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,920
You aged very well.

376
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:33,362
The first time I saw you, I was four.

377
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:35,230
Still remember it.

378
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:39,968
On the news

379
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,803
in the courtroom when
they cleared E Corp

380
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,340
of all the bullshit they
put my family through.

381
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,084
And you were in the back

382
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,621
behind a sea of suits,

383
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,757
and you laughed.

384
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:07,129
It was so quick, no one even noticed.

385
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,299
No one but me.

386
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:12,701
Four-year-old little me.

387
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:19,441
So...

388
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:20,976
I'm happy

389
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,512
I get to look you in the eye.

390
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:25,480
I have taken down your company,

391
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:28,183
taken over your home,

392
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:30,786
and now...

393
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,855
I have you.

394
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,696
Okay.

395
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,565
So you got me.

396
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:56,011
Where do we go from here?

397
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:59,481
I'm sure we can figure something out.

398
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,787
I already have.

399
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,930
She just...

400
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,933
flipped out.

401
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:56,302
I was just trying to scare her back.

402
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:01,006
It was just a stun gun.

403
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,175
No.

404
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,977
No, no, she...

405
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,980
No, she had a heart condition.

406
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:10,516
I mean, there were lots of emails

407
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,917
from her doctor.

408
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:14,019
You di...

409
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,255
you didn't see any of those?

410
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,593
No.

411
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:31,103
Just go.

412
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:34,440
You two don't need to be here.

413
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:38,878
We'll wipe down the house
and figure it out.

414
00:26:54,756 --> 00:27:10,615
_

415
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,807
You think she actually...

416
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,816
Has to be self-defense.

417
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:32,825
What's the plan?

418
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,997
We can't stay here.

419
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,065
Who knows who's gonna be
waiting for you at home?

420
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:42,201
Dark Army, FBI, cops.

421
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:46,839
I can't leave my family.

422
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,607
If you had that much to lose,

423
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,243
you shouldn't have done
this in the first place.

424
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,412
But I did this for them.

425
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,916
What we did was colossally
fucking stupid,

426
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,652
and we can't afford not
to realize that anymore.

427
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:07,826
Peace, Trent.

428
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:11,830
Yeah, I'm on my way.

429
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,213
All right, my vote,

430
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,882
we leave it here,

431
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,152
wipe our prints, and
just make a run for it.

432
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:35,354
We can't.

433
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,657
The others'll be back soon.
They'll find her.

434
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:41,160
Why don't I just... just text them

435
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:44,897
and tell them the place is burned?

436
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,498
Can't take the risk they won't listen

437
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:48,100
and come back anyway.

438
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:53,072
We need to get rid of it.

439
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:57,376
We ain't doing shit.

440
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:59,144
I'll see if my guys can take care of it.

441
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,247
Okay, no offense, but I
don't trust them either.

442
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,922
This is my responsibility.

443
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,859
Well, if this is the
part of the conversation

444
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,594
where you start throwing out ideas

445
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,730
like acid and wood chippers,

446
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,699
I ain't obliging.

447
00:29:20,735 --> 00:29:23,836
This isn't a conversation.

448
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:25,537
We need to do what we
always do when we go

449
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:27,873
into full wipe-down mode after a hack.

450
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,643
Hurry up.

451
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,620
You know you screwed me last time?

452
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:15,954
You let all the dogs go.

453
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,723
I almost got fired.

454
00:30:17,758 --> 00:30:20,492
What was that all about anyway?

455
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,828
Not like it matters. They
all ended up back here.

456
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,296
So as a matter of policy,

457
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,964
it's gonna cost you double this time.

458
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,966
Double?

459
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:29,735
Wait, we don't have double, man.

460
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,336
We... we barely pull out cash.

461
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,405
What about Ecoin?

462
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:35,441
It's worth more than cash anyway.

463
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:38,310
Pull out your phone.

464
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,783
What the fuck is in there?

465
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:47,486
I'm paying you enough for privacy.

466
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,129
It's done.

467
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,566
All yours.

468
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:11,977
Susan donated them
from her cold storage.

469
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:15,814
It's not as if she can use them anymore.

470
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,317
She can pay for her own funeral.

471
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:22,454
No...

472
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,156
Oh, no, easy, easy, wait.

473
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:26,191
Just move it...

474
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:30,295
God.

475
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,466
Rug's too big.

476
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:35,901
No shit.

477
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,574
We need to take her out.

478
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:48,347
This is some traumatizing shit.

479
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:50,015
You know that?

480
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:15,007
Hey.

481
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:17,142
Come to my place tonight.

482
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,878
Come on, let's get some sleep.

483
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:21,113
You shouldn't be alone right now.

484
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,148
I didn't know I could do that.

485
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:31,723
You did what you had to do.

486
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,792
No, that's the thing.

487
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:37,596
I don't feel bad.

488
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,866
I always knew there was a part of me

489
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:45,571
that wanted to do this to her
for what she did, but...

490
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:48,307
I figured when the time came,

491
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,742
something would stop me...

492
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,680
But it didn't.

493
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:04,990
Hey, come on. Look,
you're just in shock.

494
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,559
All right? Look, come on.

495
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:10,395
Just... let's get some sleep.

496
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:11,930
Okay?

497
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:28,814
I did what you say for me.

498
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,250
Okay, I used key under mat.
I put pizza inside.

499
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:33,919
No one inside. No one.

500
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:36,355
You didn't see anything weird or...

501
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,656
No, no one inside.

502
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,858
No one inside.

503
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,460
Okay, fine.

504
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:45,464
That's $20.

505
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,333
Wait.

506
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,002
Uh...

507
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:53,872
ca... can I... can I
have the other pizza?

508
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,641
It's another delivery, man.

509
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,476
It's another delivery.

510
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,211
Look, give me the other pizza.
I'm fucking nervous, man.

511
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,687
Have you guys ever thought about moving?

512
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:10,656
What's this?

513
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,558
Maybe we should move somewhere cheaper.

514
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,230
I don't think the city is safe anymore,

515
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,965
not with everything going on.

516
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,567
Don't be silly. Moving
is impossible right now.

517
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,169
The bank is fighting us on the deed.

518
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:26,738
It's a mess. They're not
letting anyone sell.

519
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,340
In fact, we may be at a bigger risk

520
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,976
of losing the money we
did invest in this home.

521
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,411
But we can find another place.

522
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,527
Dinner's almost ready.

523
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:49,561
I'll check outside.

524
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:29,601
Sir, open up. FBI.

525
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:34,639
Sir, if you don't open the door,

526
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,708
we're gonna break it down.

527
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:53,339
Mr. Markesh, we didn't

528
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,074
mean for you to be
waiting here this long,

529
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:56,742
but with all the
bureaucracy and red tape,

530
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:58,477
it's getting a little
bonkers around here.

531
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:00,513
Yeah, well, I've been
waiting here all night.

532
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,414
What the fuck is going on?

533
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,017
I feel your pain.

534
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:06,952
I've been stuck here all night too.

535
00:36:06,988 --> 00:36:09,488
It's depressing, isn't it?

536
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:17,363
Here's what we're gonna do.

537
00:36:17,398 --> 00:36:20,332
We're gonna talk, and all
you have to do is listen.

538
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:22,635
Because, believe it or not, Mr. Markesh,

539
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,036
you could be real instrumental

540
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:26,372
in helping to solve this Five/Nine case.

541
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:31,243
Leslie Romero.

542
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:42,388
Forgive me, hon, you do know
your friend was found murdered?

543
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:51,330
My heart goes out to you.
It's very unfortunate.

544
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,468
I went over to his mother's
after everything went down.

545
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,137
I wanted to offer my condolences,

546
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:02,007
and I took a quick look around
while I was over there.

547
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:03,876
That's when I found this.

548
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:08,180
An end of the world party
featuring DJ Mobley.

549
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:09,915
I'm not an EDM fan myself,

550
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:12,151
but a quick search on
the wayback machine,

551
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:15,721
and guess what we found
all the way from 2003.

552
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:17,423
You.

553
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,191
An Angelfire page that you created

554
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:21,160
from back in the day.

555
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,996
Your very own DJ Mobley fan page.

556
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,898
In fact, curiously enough,

557
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:29,602
you were the only one that ever
created a fan page of this guy.

558
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:32,071
Must have really spoken to you.

559
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,039
Trust me, I feel the same way

560
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:36,075
about "Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion."

561
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:41,146
But like you, I found myself
very much in the minority.

562
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:48,921
So a big fan.

563
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:52,057
Obscure DJ with a unique name.

564
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:53,626
Seems like the perfect recipe

565
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,995
for how a hacker handle gets born.

566
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:02,134
Here's the deal:

567
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:04,370
we want Tyrell Wellick,

568
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:06,872
not Tyrell Wellick's DJ.

569
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,274
Your friend is dead, and
that's a sad thing,

570
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,310
but at this point, the best
thing that could happen

571
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:14,446
would be if there's something
you can tell me...

572
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:17,549
names, people,

573
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,585
any information at all

574
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,022
that you can give us from
that party that would help.

575
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:39,204
Lawyer.

576
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:42,508
I want a lawyer.

577
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:49,515
Do you have any evidence on this guy?

578
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,617
This is not the strategy
we have implemented.

579
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:53,652
Top down, not bottom up.

580
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:55,654
We needed to get some traction.

581
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,489
This is a way.

582
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,425
He's a minor player that
won't blow our strategy.

583
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,160
He'll start flushing
some of these guys out.

584
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:03,295
Are you not watching the news?

585
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,330
We are in a world of shit

586
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:08,100
because of this leaked conference call.

587
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,203
The OPR is going to be
coming down on us any day.

588
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:13,272
It's all over the Senate
Intelligence Hearings.

589
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,606
The deputy director,

590
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:16,008
assistant director of Cyber Division

591
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:19,211
and the EAD are all getting fired.

592
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:22,514
Comey's about to announce that
Operation Berenstain is dead,

593
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,384
and you just held this guy for 12 hours

594
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:26,952
for no reason.

595
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:29,588
You have to think about
how this looks, Dom.

596
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:40,899
Whatever paranoia you've
put into him is done,

597
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:43,702
just by picking him up.

598
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:45,904
Let him go.

599
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,504
_

600
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:47,588
_

601
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:08,821
I'll be back later.

602
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:50,262
I lost her.

603
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:51,530
I don't know what I did wrong.

604
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,198
I thought she was into me.

605
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:54,800
Don't let it get you in the dumps.

606
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,468
Getting into the mind of a woman,

607
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:59,538
it's the toughest route for
even the best sources.

608
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,139
I can't get into it right now.

609
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,342
This fsociety video's
blowing up in our face.

610
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,611
That's some fucked-up shit you guys did.

611
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:07,145
It's got me all paranoid.

612
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:09,448
How do I know you guys
aren't watching me too?

613
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,484
We look like fools. Shit's
worse than Snowden.

614
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,686
Privacy rights activist Edward Snowden.

615
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:16,455
When you say I don't care

616
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,890
- about the right to privacy...
- Speak of the devil.

617
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,057
Because I have nothing to hide,

618
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:20,726
that's no different than saying

619
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:21,960
I don't care about freedom of speech

620
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,395
because I have nothing to say.

621
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,630
Despite the cybersecurity breach

622
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:25,998
in obtaining the information

623
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:27,399
on Operation Berenstain,

624
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:29,401
the controversy over privacy rights

625
00:42:29,436 --> 00:42:32,337
has prompted calls for greater
government transparency.

626
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:35,307
- Advocates are demanding...
- Look, I'm done with this.

627
00:42:35,342 --> 00:42:38,343
You know, she's stone cold anyway, Dom.

628
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:40,545
I'm not gonna lie...

629
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:42,915
I kinda got hurt.

630
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,850
She never talked about fsociety

631
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:46,818
or her old friends from back in the day?

632
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:49,521
She hasn't given up anything
since you first put me on her,

633
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:52,257
and she bailed on me for
some old dude at the bar.

634
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:54,693
A contact?

635
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:57,496
I think she's just into old dudes.

636
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,732
Paying employees only a
portion of their wages.

637
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:04,770
In a statement, UWUA leaders claimed...

638
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:23,255
Cisco?

639
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:35,968
Cisco?

640
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:37,636
Yo, what's up?

641
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:53,752
What's up?

642
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:05,163
How long you been up?

643
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,798
I just got up.

644
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:08,100
I jumped straight in the shower.

645
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:09,968
I'll be out in a sec, though.

646
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,703
You all right?

647
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:20,579
Yeah, fine.

648
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,393

649
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:51,549
_

650
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,618

651

_

653
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:37,222
You all right?

654
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:47,399
Yo, what the fuck?
